1,The Hanson brothers  Andy apparently has his act together and Hank clearly doesnt have his act together need money Andy comes up with a scheme to get some dough that will have consequences for the whole Hanson family This film delivers This is a layered fullblooded roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it is doing As a crime drama  thriller I would happily compare it to No Country For Old Men While both films have have an ample supply of character drama and thrills Devil is more on the thriller side because of its fast pace No Country is a colder and bleaker film that you can really admire while Devil is a bit more enjoyable There is definitely less violence in Devil than No Country The acting delivers as well Ethan Hawke sometimes wooden in the past brings the jitters sweating and the deerintheheadlightslook to the besieged Hank Philip Seymour Hoffman as Andy has the films hardest scenes and is fast becoming the actor who you believe can do anything Theres really not much wrong with this film It jumps back and forth without being confusing Events spiral out of control but the film never does  the writing from first timer Kelly Masterson directing veteran Sidney Lumet and the editing stay as tight as a drum In many categories this is award caliber stuff though maybe films like The Departed and No Country squeezed this one out of the limelight If you liked those youll like this
1,If Saura hadnt done anything like this before Iberia would be a milestone Now it still deserves inclusion to honor a great director and a great cinematic conservator of Spanish culture but he has done a lot like this before and though we can applaud the riches he has given us we have to pick and choose favorites and high points among similar films which include Blood Wedding 1981 Carmen 1983 El Amore Brujo 1986 Sevillanas 1992 SalomÃ© 2002 and Tango 1998 I would choose Sauras 1995 Flamenco as his most unique and potent cultural document next to which Iberia pales Iberia is conceived as a series of interpretations of the music of Isaac Manuel Francisco AlbÃ©niz 18601909 and in particular his Iberia suite for piano Isaac AlbÃ©niz was a great contributor to the externalization of Spanish musical culture  its reformatting for a nonSpanish audience He moved to France in his early thirties and was influenced by French composers His Iberia suite is an imaginative synthesis of Spanish folk music with the styles of Liszt Dukas and dIndy He traveled around performing his compositions which are a kind of beautiful standardization of Spanish rhythms and melodies not as homogenized as Ravels Bolero but moving in that direction Naturally the Spanish have repossessed AlbÃ©niz and in Iberia the performers reinterpret his compositions in terms of various more ethnic and regional dances and styles But the source is a tamed and diluted form of Spanish musical and dance culture compared to the echt Spanishness of pure flamenco Flamenco coming out of the region of Andalusia is a deeply felt amalgam of gitane HispanoArabic and Jewish cultures Iberia simply is the peninsula comprising Spain Portugal Andorra and Gibraltar the very concept is more diluted  Sauras Flamenco is an unstoppably intense ethnic mix of music singing dancing and that peacock manner of noble preening that is the essence of Spanish style the way a man and a woman carries himself or herself with pride verging on arrogance and elegance and panache  even bullfights and the moves of the torero are full of it  in a series of electric sequences without introduction or conclusion they just are Saura always emphasized the staginess of his collaborations with choreographer Antonio Gades and other artists In his 1995 Flamenco he dropped any pretense of a story and simply has singers musicians and dancers move on and off a big sound stage with nice lighting and screens flats and mirrors arranged by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro another of the Spanish filmmakers important collaborators The beginnings and endings of sequences in Flamenco are often rough but atmospheric marked only by the rumble and rustle of shuffling feet and a mixture of voices Sometimes the film keeps feeding when a performance is over and you see the dancer bend over sigh or laugh or somebody just unexpectedly says something In Flamenco more than any of Sauras other musical films its the rapt intense interaction of singers and dancers and rhythmically clapping participant observers shouting impulsive olÃ©s that is the story and creates the magic Because Saura has truly made magic and perhaps best so when he dropped any sort of conventional story Iberia is in a similar style to some of Sauras purest musical films no narration no dialogue only brief titles to indicate the type of song or the region beginning with a pianist playing Albenizs music and gradually moving to a series of dance sequences and a little singing In flamenco music the fundamental element is the unaccompanied voice and that voice is the most unmistakable and unique contribution to world music It relates to other songs in other ethnicities but nothing quite equals its raw raucous unique uglybeautiful cry that defies you to do anything but listen to it with the closest attention Then comes the clapping and the foot stomping and then the dancing combined with the other elements There is only one flamenco song in Iberia If you love Sauras Flamenco youll want to see Iberia but youll be a bit disappointed The style is there some of the great voices and dancing and music are there But Iberias source and conception doom it to a lesser degree of power and make it a less rich and intense cultural experience
0,There is one really good scene in Faat Kine The title character gets in an argument with another woman and after being threatened Faat Kine sprays her in the face The scene works because the act is so unexpected bizarre and rather funny at the same time In that one instance writerdirector Ousmane Sembene gives the audience a character that is easy to root for an interesting film character that could be worth watching for two hours In the scene he presents a brave woman who is bold in her actions For the rest of the movie the only other thing he seems to present is conflicting tones  The tone is all over the place Its true not all movies have to clearly fit within a specific genre but I dont think Faat Kine fits into any genre Supposedly its a drama though there are moments of such broad comedy the aforementioned spraying in the face that it cannot be taken seriously On the other hand the film is certainly not a comedy with the abundant amount of serious topics Sembene has crammed into the picture There is a way to successfully mix comedy and drama together Unfortunately Semebene doesnt find that balance Instead one scene after another just drift into each other without much rhyme or reason leaving two different tones hanging in the wind  Faat Kine also has the problem of running two hours long with an extremely drawn out finale The film ends with a big party where all the characters conflicts are resolved only they arent resolved quickly The scene lasts longer than any other scene going on for probably twenty minutes Because the rest of the scenes up until this point have been meandering the finale is particularly hard to endure with repetition beginning early on in the scene making for a frustrating viewing experience Perhaps I am being too hard on Faat Kine I am not the right audience for it I felt nothing towards the characters and had no connection to any part of the story There are people who will probably find something meaningful in the story and see strong characters However I was unable to do so and thus cannot recommend it
1,I would say that this film gives an insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster I would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a family I found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a multitude of dimensions The scary monster although probably not scary to most adults has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might create I found the film to be delightful
1,Cry Freedom is a movie about how far people will go to find the truth The first half is an interesting portrayal of an unlikely friendship between activist Steve Biko and Editor Don Woods played fanatically by Dezel Washington and Kevin Klein While the second half deals with Woods looking for answers on Bikos death Although most people favor the first half of the movie which focuses on the unlikely friendship between Biko and Woods I found the second half about Don woods struggle to have Bikos story be heard around the world much more interesting
0,They said it would be a film greater than Turks Fruit How dare they Its not even 10 of this classic Bad acting The only character i felt sympathy for was the one played by Angela Schijf Her acting was the best in the whole film The story couldve been interesting but it wasnt Some scenes were very beautiful filmed lights and camera the opening scene for example but the bad acting made the magic disappear I really dont understand why so many people voted this film so good
1,I have to start off by apologizing because I thought the first 7580 of this film was hilarious Its mostly because of Brad Pitts performance Spot on The acting by all involved was quite good but Brad stole the movie The atmosphere was perfect in all respects Im not a giant Pitt fan but this has got to be one of his best roles ever BrutalHonestGritty All good words to describe this movie I was reading a previous review and the person said that the reasoning behind Earlys violence isnt explained It is explained but they thankfully dont have to go into graphic detail to get their point across Overall I gave this a 9 because every scene bar 1 or 2 was effective I think the humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie Underrated
0,I find it amazing that so many people probably Poles have voted for this movie giving it such grades mostly tens OK the movie was fine funny but it was nothing special on the other hand The only good thing about Kiler is the dialogues rather not comprehensive for nonPoles Screenplay is primitive the acting except for Jerzy Stuhr as Ryba  awful Its too much ado about nothing  fortunately its not included in the top 250 PS The sequel Kilerow 2och 2 Kilers is on the way and its just the same story
0,Aside from a few good moments of fairly raw violence this painful film is most notable for making 68 minutes seem like two hours It starts with an interminably long intro where the Leeds family is introduced including two insufferable tykes and their adult brother and sister completely clichÃ©d Pa and Ma and incredibly annoying Grandpa played by Charles Chic Sales While sitting down to dinner the family is disturbed by the sounds of gunfire and rushes to the window in time to see two men gunned down by mobsters in the street The mobsters flee through the familys house leaving them as witnesses to the crime The rest of the movie consists of Walter Huston as the crusading DA occasionally interrupting long anticrime speeches to make half hearted attempts at trying to protect the family from the mob It all winds up in a predictable manner Good points about the movie include a couple of decent shootouts and a truly nasty beating Nat Pendleton as one of the mobsters and the gorgeous Sue Blane in a small role as the Leeds daughter  If you want to watch Huston play his early trademark crusading lawman try 1932s Beast of the City Avoid this one if at all possible
0,Movie There are some very interesting comments on IMDb about this movie Its truly awful Not enough money is spent on the movie and the way Spike Lee has made it it seems like a combination of an indie film and an action flick CharactersActors Denzel has done EXACTLY what he does in every movie so no surprise there Here is a little mind game for the readers Quickly think of 10 Denzel movies Now count how many of them were in which he played a copdetectivebody guard whatever Clive Owen hmmmmmm this guy needs a better role on his plate soon His best performance was I think in Beyond Borders Other than that he did pretty much the same thing as he does in every movie as well His tone and way of talking was very similar to what he did in Sin City Surely this guy knows acting what he doesnt know is better way of choosing roles He is in desperate need of a better agent Jodie Foster was brilliant in the movie if you are watching her for the first time in your life She has done better She has had better roles It so happens in Hollywood that even the biggest stars fall down on their knees and pick up low class roles as Jody Foster did in this movie Plot Plot was not confusing in fact I could think of such a plot in fact the whole movie while taking a dump after a nice big Chinese dinner I mean come on SPOILER ON THE WAY I am sick of the unnecessary Haulocast and the Racism token The movie is about bank robbers why put the Haulocast and the Racism in there nice try playing with peoples emotions worked on anyone NOT ME Police let the bank robbers go thinking they were hostages Riiiiiiight please were talking about US police force and security here Nobody could find out where Clive was I mean they didnt find anything different with that room Whore we kidding Conclusion Sure go watch this movie if nothing youll have a nice time talking to you friends how bad the movie was At least people wont think youre stupid to go watch this movie because theyd think you went to watch it because it has a big star cast MISTAKE
1,A beloved and devoted priest from a small town volunteers for a medical experiment which fails and turns him into a vampire  Physical and psychological changes lead to his affair with a wife of his childhood friend who is repressed and tired of her mundane life  The onetime priest falls deeper in despair and depravity As things turns for worse he struggles to maintain whats left of his humanity The vampire movie should have really been extinct now thanks to the poor efforts of the Twilight and Underworld franchises but the director injects new blood into the story of the vampire by putting simple things into perspective These vampires have reflections and no fangs but still feed and die the same Making the main protagonist a priest really opens up a can of worms for questioning ones acts The priest primarily feeds to make himself better but when he meets his friends unfulfilled wife carnal instincts set in What makes this film intensely erotic is that when the couple consent for the first time they are experiencing something they have never before forbidden passion which makes the scenario all that more sensual ChanWook adds some much needed humour into the film but this is only realised in the final third of the movie We see the daughter lift her mother in the chair in front of everyone and when she realises her own strength just puts the chair down and carry on Hilarious and the final act wouldnt be out of place in a carry on film or even the three Stooges as the couple fight for survivaldeath respectively CGI is subtle and fantastic and the scenes with them jumping from building to building is so graceful you could be watching ballet The vampire genre feels fresh and vibrant after this but more importantly has the eroticism and intensity that most vampire films are missing these days Its violent but from the director in question i wouldnt expect anything different A really interesting story with fantastic characters and beautiful cinematography
1,You know what they say about the 70sif you can remember them you werent there One of the few things I do remember about the 70s was the very first hippie and hip social satire as seen from a totally undergroundor counterculture perspectiveThe Groove Tube If the humor seems faded or witless now to some viewers it can only be because a lot has happened in the last 30 years and the comedy isnt fresh anymorebut hey When this movie came out it was a firstand some of these skits were being done for the very first timeat a time when Nixon was in office the Vietnam war was raging the sexual revolution was in full swingand JEdgar Hoover was still in charge of the FBI This is a film made before Watergate broke and as such it was one of the first to take a big swipe at the establishmentto make fun of it and the hippies at the same time And frankly some skits are still dead funny If you liked Cheech and Chongs Up In Smokeyou will LOVE this film If you want to know what the 70s were really likecheck out the Groove Tube if you liked the Oscar winning Network from about the same year and thought it was right on the mark in its savage look at TV you will dig the Groove Tubewhich picks up on the theme but plays from the angle of the viewersthe young viewers who were turning off the TV in favor of other entertainments We had been raised on Ozzie  Harriet Leave It to Beaver Father Knows Best My Three SonsHappy Daysso imagine our glee when those of us who were experimenting with the new lifestyles got to see a send up of the box as seen from our perspective The commercials by the Uranus corporation alone are pricelessGood things come from Uranusand the sudden break from straight film into Fritz the Catstyle animation when the hippies eat the weed is still one of the best segues in and out of sanity i have ever seen on film If you liked the Kentucky Fried Movie you will LOVE this film And if you ever wondered why your weird uncle Harold still gets a wicked gleam in his eye when thinking back to his college daysthis would be the perfect film to watch Take it for what it isa memento of the timesand a sassy little film that will help all of us who did forget the 70s to remember them anew
0,Im embarrassed to be writing this review I say that because those of you reading it will know that I sat through the whole thing and that is embarrassing to admit even to strangers But I just had to warn those who read the viewer comments on IMDb before they watch a film not to watch this one Its the least I can do This is a bad movie Trust me The plot is goofy The acting is amateurish And the directing camera work sets costumes etc are all second rate Let it go
0,By the standards of Hollywood this movie was filmed and edited as Hollywood movies are and therefore looked like a movie you would get out of a bigtime production studio within Hollywood Thats where anything remotely close to having Hollywood standards ends This was THE WORST MOVIE I have EVER seen in MY LIFE I am not joking The story was so unbelievably stupid and unrealistic that I could not contain my laughter in the movie theater through the course of watching this film I know what youre saying its a horror film its not supposed to have a good story its supposed to scare you Well let me tell you something the movie is not even scary in the least bit Its too full of stupid bits that cancels out the little suspense there may have been The acting was awful as well along with the scariness of the murderer who you constantly see through flashbacks locked in a cage jacking off Throughout the movie I kept getting a sense I was watching something that was thought up written produced and directed by a highschooler who watches too much pornography Please dont see this movie spend your 850 on other things like a snow cone which would be much more worth your while
0,The core message is strong the cast has given it their best shot the packaging is excellent but the screenplay is seriously overdramatized and every cliche in the book on womens suffering in India has been overused to the max
0,Theres nothing worse than renting an Asian movie and getting an American movie experience instead Its only my opinion but a good thriller is dependent upon the establishment of likable intelligent characters As far as likability is concerned the protagonists in Say Yes are a quaint married couple Nicely done Unfortunately they are stupid beyond belief Let us count the ways they mishandle being terrorized by a stalker 1 After a hitchhiker threatens to kill you be sure to tell him what hotel youre staying at when you drop him off 2 Beat the hell out of the stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses thereby allowing him to press charges of assault 3 Dont bother telling the police about the stalker and simply assume for no apparently good reason that the cops were bribed by him 4 While trying to escape let your lady out of your sight as much as possible to ensure that the stalker kidnaps her 5 After getting help from someone to find the stalker after kidnapping your wife be sure to send them away as soon as possible so you can face him oneonone No point in being unfair right  Now Id never expect that any person would be immune to making a few mistakes under these stressful conditions but the characters in Say Yes are so dense and make so many unbelievable mistakes that its effectively impossible for the viewer to care about their safety since they are victims of their own doing This kills the enjoyability of the entire film  In case you were wondering the scriptwriters didnt stop with dimwitted characters Since they themselves are surely dimwitted for writing this crapfest they decided to make situations so absurdly unrealistic that all sense of reality goes out the window 1 The stalker kills a cop inside a police station Â– while the protagonist is asleep no more than ten feet away 2 The stalker engages in all sorts of dubious activities in broad daylight and around tons of people yet no one other than the married couple seems to notice his odd behavior 3 The stalker survives an absurd amount of violence that would have killed any human being 4 The suspense scenes had no imagination whatsoever In fact some scenes were direct ripoffs from American movies The only positive is the decapitation near the end which was a pretty brutal scene since it was inflicted upon the wife Its too bad the filmmakers followed it up with an outrageously stupid ending that comes out of left field Truly the Koreans behind the making of Say Yes should be ashamed of themselves Better yet they should just move to California and take employment with people who make movies with a similar disregard for quality and intelligence
1,Cry Freedom is not just a movie It is a historical account heroic story and insight into the cultural background of a major event in history Not only does Denzel Washington do a terrific job of impersonating a motivating determined hero Steve Biko but he delivers a message to the public about the horrors of South Arfrican Apartheid The story of Biko an influential leader and his main influencee Donald Woods is a heartbreaking one But the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa Cry Freedom manages to communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot It is because of great films like this one that the public can become educated on terrible events in history great leaders who sought to end them and how we can never allow them to happen in the future Because of this importance Cry Freedom is an amazing film that should be seen by all
1,In the early 19th century a young woman with a harelip falls foul of her familys ambition and the superstitions of the local community but she meets a man who may see her differently and just may change Prus life forever Precious Bane is a British Broadcasting Corporation adaptation of the highly acclaimed novel by Mary Webb Its a beautifully filmed piece that is acted to an incredibly high standard the story screenplay by Maggie Wadey is excellent and the period detail and use of dialect is second to none Its such a shame that this film has yet to get a DVD release one would have thought that with Clive Owens great here as Gideon rise to stardom the BBC would get it out there but sadly no so the only way of catching it is on the very rare occasions that TCM shows it The lead performance from Janet McTeer as Pru Sarn is simply brilliant guts and genuine emotion go hand in hand as McTeer gives it her all Pru has to not only contend with her facial disfigurement but also the constant snides and hurt from the ignorant villagers This is a time when folk believed that if a Hare ran in front of a pregnant woman it spelt doom a time of Bull Baiting a time of superstitions and talk of witches In spite of constant set backs Pru is strong and resourceful even her own family knock her dreams back without realising it but this road may well be a terribly bumpy one but hope is everlasting and Pru has hope in abundance 8510
1,I went to this movie expecting an artsy scary film What I got was scare after scare Its a horror film at its core Its not dull like other horror films where a haunted house just has ghosts and gore This film doesnt even show you the majority of the deaths it shows the fear of the characters I think one of the best things about the concept where its not just the house thats haunted its whoever goes into the house They become haunted no matter where they are Office buildings police stations hotel rooms etc After reading some of the external reviews I am really surprised that critics didnt like this film I am going to see it again this week and am excited about it I gave this film 10 stars because it did what a horror film should It scared the st out of me
0,I love a good Western movie but this was more like watching a play on stage or an act at the local street carnival show I could only stand 38 minutes of it in hopes that it would improve but it only got worse and I had to end it Each actors stated the lines as if reading directly from the script or cue cards There was too much predictability to the lines and actions not as if a natural occurrence or conversation The wig on Rachel Kimsey was obvious The actresses playing Native American sisters could have played nonnative parts and should have Wardrobe for the Native Americans could have been better and a little more authentic looking If I decide to watch it with any friends in the future I will do so not with the expectations of watching a good Western but with the expectations of watching an amateur comedy film production
1,Prisons are not exactly renowned for their kind hospitality and happy vibes what with stories of fights chaos murder and of course extreme male bonding But the prison in this film is a different beast altogether Horror films set in cells are as you probably know nothing particularly new as they emphasis and exaggerate the fear of claustrophobia and the inability of escape Â– two of the greatest themes in horror cinema With such examples as THE CHAIR Waldermar Korzeniowsky 1988 THE GREEN MILE Frank Darabont 1999 ALIEN 3 David Fincher 1992and of course the entire Women In Prison exploitation genre itself another entry into this niche has to be something inventive and a lot of fun to boot in order to be recognised Or at least thats what youd have thought PRISON is certainly an incredibly fun and enjoyable ride and its somewhat of a shame that it isnt as well known as it should be The film in short centres on an old prison well duh which has been reopened However its not just fellow inmates and guards the prisoners have to fear but also a mean ass demon ghost spirit with only one thing on its mind death And boy are we treated to some awesome death scenes I wont spoil anything here for you but there are plenty of innovative and enjoyable murders all done by invisible hands Besides the special effects and the murders this film also has another thing going for it its cast Headlining we have LORD OF THE RINGS Peter Jackson 20012003 star Viggo Mortensen and for all those so inclined yes he does get naked whose performance is not only highly believable but is done with such skill that his Eastwoodesquire character is both badtothebone and likable a very delicate mix Add him to a cast of heywaitaminuteIknowthatguy actors and youve got yourself one great set of stars The characters themselves however lack threedimensionality and more often than not come across as very stereotypical Weve got a black oculist a hardasnails prison warden a humanrights activist woman and plenty of other stock characters But in all honesty this fault actually aids the film Instead of boring character development in an overlong equilibrium we are chucked more or less straight into the action and once it gets going very early on theres not a single scene thats a filler Â– its balls to the wall plot Unlike a certain SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION Frank Darabont 1994  Sharing conventions with the slasher genre this is somewhat of a convention itself and in good ol slasher genre tradition PRISON punishes those who have been bad All in all this is an excellent little horror film and one which is sadly overlooked and unmentioned among the horror world With an excellent cast and great special effects and rather original death scenes this film is highly recommended to horror fans Dont be fooled into thinking itll be a cheesy little film either just because it was made in USA 1980s its far from cheesy although the very end does ruin this and simultaneously far from gritty and realistic whilst it attempts to tackle issues such as prison rape these are rather subtly done I give it 35 out of 5 luvs A very entertaining horror film with some very nice touches indeed
1,You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it The film opens with images of planes landing at an airport one plane after another diving into a miragefilled runway You will be able to accurately guess that this movie is not about a story At first viewing its even easy to think the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane The initial drama is in the acuteness of your perception which is built on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images If after this opening you want to see the movie you will not be bored You may even be mesmerized The movie may be an emotional experience it may be an intellectual experience it may be both Judging from the DVD commentary which is essential it was primarily an emotional experience for Herzog and at one point he talks explicitly about how the film is a collaboration between filmmaker and viewer Theres plenty of room for the viewer to make of this film exactly what he or she wants to make of it Take a gamble
0,This one is one of those classic B movie following the exploits of 2 hobos Its done really cheesily and Big Stupid running off oneliners like a cardboard cassanova But Jack Elam steals every scene hes in as the creepazoid Jesse now Jerome My favorite scene is the lynch mob and the dads voice going up 10 octaves You loved her Danny Big Stupids protege is surprisingly stupider but not as loathsome as our lead star Theres also a quaint scene of a guy pimping at the diner Joyce Meadows is the sweet naive nice gal and probably the least annoying And those yellow ruffles RAWR Oh and booze is evil according to Mr Stupid This movies a hoot Watch the MST cover of this and Crows terrific Elam homage
1,One night I was listening to talk radio and they had Leslie Nielsen on the program He went on to explain why there were only 6 shows  With TV shows like MASH you could go to the fridge to get a beer and as long as you heard what was going on you didnt miss anything But with Police Squad you HAD to watch the show with the sight gags you missed a whole lot if you didnt see them Who could forget  the part of town known as Little Italy with the coliseum in the background Even the movies relied heavily on the sight gags but then again being in the theater you were a captive audience Leslie also said the one reason the show movies and other movies like Airplane were funny is because they didnt attempt to tell what was funny It was up to the viewer to get the jokes Well thats just my 2 cents
1,Fabulous fantastic probably Disneys best musical adventure I have loved this film for over 35 years because it is so imaginative clever and fun Even despite the silly flying bed scenes the other scenes and dialog are magical and funny Could they have picked anyone better than Angela Lansbury to play Eglantine I cannot think of anyone more suited to the role Remaking this classic would be as stupid as remaking Mary Poppins David Tomlinson though he had few quality movie roles absolutely shines in this adventure He was a comic genius who is often forgotten nowadays Blustering prim and proper Englishman  nobody could really do slapstick and pull it off as gracefully as he does It would be tragic to remake this film because Tomlinson has been deceased for a few years and nobody could step into his shoes and do his character justice The dancing nightgowns and armor have a magical aura about them that other movies with witches just dont capture I particularly enjoy the parts where the Germans invade Eglantines house and she must defend it in any way she can Bobbing along bobbing along on the bottom of the beautiful briny sea Richard and Robert Sherman outdid themselves on the musical numbers All of them are fantastic and worth remembering Portobello Road being one of my favorites A great film that still holds up today
1,The movie Frailty is actually more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror film It has all the trappings of a horror film but this it is not Frailty is a film about perceptions of religion and realizing the differences between right and wrong In Frailty a middleaged father Bill Paxton and his two sons claim to be doing the work of God It turns out that they are a trio of notorious serial killers called Gods Hands We watch the father kill the demons in some rather brutal ways while convincing his sons and himself that they are doing the work God and that what they are doing is right He claims that he received a message from an angel who gave him specific instructions to eliminate the demons living here on earth God has given him a list of names and in return for his services he and his sons will be given protection which basically means the police will never be able to capture them We see all of this unfold in front of us in a very disturbing manner But what is really disturbing about it all is the effect that it has on the two sons particularly the oldest son Adam Adam himself seriously doubts the existence of a supreme being that is until his father and a week in the cellar changes all of that He knows that his father has obviously lost his mind and is pretty sure the same is happening to his younger brother Fenton Fenton the other half of this puzzle takes everything in as if it were his own religion He seems trapped in his fathers world of God and demons I suppose this is because hes so young and easily impressionable But everything that happens to these three is rather convincing in fact TOO convincing  The events that occur in the film can be looked upon as a vivid hallucination that is being experienced by the three main characters I say this because they each react to the situation in different ways and at one point in the film they each claim to see God Dad first sees the murders as his mission His mission eventually consumes him and quickly turns into an obsession with eradicating demons In fact his hallucination is the primary one His orders and the list of names he receives are all a part of this hallucination Watch the scene where Dad finds the ax in a barn to figure out where I am coming from Fenton the younger son is easily impressed by all of this talk of demons and destruction Since he is so young its easy for him to fall into his fathers trap Adam on the other is very skeptical towards his fathers actions  SPOILERS  In a way the hallucination ends when Dad is killed towards the end of the movie I will not say how or under what circumstances But I will say that it is not pleasant After his death it fastforwards to the present day The story is being told through flashbacks as seen through the eyes of the oldest son Adam In actuality it is Fenton that is telling the story not Adam as originally believed The story is being told the way he perceived it through his actions and his brothers actions Fenton has gone insane and is continuing what his father started by luring the FBI agent into his trap Since religion is a major theme in this movie the film also plays on how easy it is for religion to be misinterpreted by those that do not have a full understanding of it Before Dad discovered his newfound mission he himself did not have a clear understanding of religion nor did he fully believe in a supreme being His sons Fenton and Adam often sang innocent little childrens church hymns but yet probably did not have a clear understanding of what the lyrics meant After the revelation of Dads newfound mission they both took off in separate directions  Adam remained in doubt of there being a supreme being while Fenton was gradually sucked into his fathers madness  A very good thriller that will creep the heck out of you do not watch it alone
0,Stealing Time actually dates back to 2001 when it was mysteriously titled Rennies Landing Which explains how director Marc Fusco was able to afford this cast of now established televisionmovie actors in what is obviously an extremely low budget production About ten minutes into the film you understand why this thing never got a theatrical release after it made the film festival rounds several years ago  Its recent distribution by Franchise Pictures probably reflects a perception that the rising popularity of certain cast members can be milked to recover some of the modest production costs Although not a great addition to anyones resume young actors have done worse things when they were desperately seeking acting work of any kind Peter Facinelli Ethan Embry Scott Foley and Charlotte Ayanna play college friends who do an early Big Chill reunion and compare war stories about the failure of reality to measure up to their dreams  Unfortunately nothing else happens absolutely nothing Yes Alec Facinelli dreams about a liquor store holdup and a bank robbery which are then cheaply and lamely staged to completely inappropriate music It is the least suspenseful bank job since WC Fields was the guard in The Bank Dick  If anyone can point to any moment in Stealing Time where something actually happens I would like to know about it because as far as I can tell not a thing happens in the whole film Perhaps Fusco through incessant visual reflections is trying to say something profound about taking control of ones life before it is too late Like St Elmos Fire the movie is littered with every profound thought ever uttered by a young adult who has left the ivory tower to experience the real world for the first time I felt Fusco was going for a kind of Howard Hawks Young Professionals in Action Only Angels Have Wings motif Then again Im sure I was reading much too much into the film After all things actually happen Howard Hawks films Then again what do I know Im only a child
0,This one is bad A really bad and boring crime movie that has nothing out of the ordinary in it A series of crimes the killer that you do not see throughout the whole movie the classic investigations And also the classic tale about a cop who figures out whats going on and isnt believed by anyone so he has to fight by himself to reveal the truth Not too much in this one Vote 4 out of 10
1,Definitely not only for urban legend aficionados Campfire Tales is an often scary and always fun ride through several popular stories It is also a film that exceeded the low expectations I had A horror film I had never heard or read about a straighttovideo release granted the latter often presents us with a pleasant surprise but with horror films nowadays it can be all or nothing a cast of mostly unknowns well Ill leave the math to you The film proves to be an entertaining suspenseful and overall very enjoyable experience The four stories are wellpaced and satisfying The only one I felt was a little weaker was The Locket for the simple reason that it offers almost no explanation for its plot or the characters actions however I still loved the tale its atmosphere and ending My favorite one was the third story People Can Lick Too  the suspense in it is not only palpable but also educational I found Campfire Tales to be one of those horror gems one discovers by chance and then goes on recommending it to everyone 710
0,From the epicenter of the cultural globe four working class teenagers attempted to change the world through music and fashion It was the final attempt to do so last century and they failed Before the dust had cleared band manager and SEX shop proprietor Malcolm McLaren spent the money The Sex Pistols had earned to make a mockumentary about his own role in their success The film was called The Great Rock n Roll Swindle take the hint and consists of very little footage of The Sex Pistols actually playing music and quite a lot of footage of McLaren effectively calling the audience idiots Codsurrealist nonsense in which guitarist Steve Jones is a detective on McLarens tail soon dissolves so he and drummer Paul Cook can jet off to Rio and spend time with great train robber Ronnie Biggs Ready yourself for the spectacle of three very unappealing men dancing naked to a hideous ironyfree version of Belsen was a Gas a song about killing Jews for gold in BergenBelsen concentration camp and another song sung in Ronnies tone deaf whine which includes the lyrics God save Myra Hindley God save Ian Brady lyrics that Johnny Rotten would have considered distasteful The Sid Vicious scenes are few and idiotic Jumping out of bed in a thong with a swastika over the testicles to sing some bad boy biker song from the 50s Playing into to the Punks a joke theme of the movie in an attempt to turn Sid into James Dean Im surprised McLaren doesnt take credit for Siddys death too The redeeming scenes are those of Sid in Paris and the infamous performance of My Way The punk rock zeitgeist right there Mocking an adoring audience before shooting them all No need for an entire film just watch that clip on YouTube From Julien Temples far superior and more enjoyable 2001 documentary followup The Filth and the Fury we were given a more balancedhonest view of what transpired in 78 But there were also a number of scenes that I would have liked to have seen in Swindle as Fury was basically a reediting of the same material One was an animated Sid complete with Sids voice acting You fcken betta watch out alright or Ill slice you open  a still of which appeared on the cover of the Something Else 7 inch  a snippet was shown in Fury but I dont know what context that originally appeared Was it in original prints but removed after Sids death Was there more Fury also shed light on the film Who Killed Bambi which would have been the mock Hard Days Night movie McLaren was originally intending to make It starred Sting as a member of a gay New Romantics group and looked a damn sight more entertaining than Swindle Sod Swindle tis a swindle If you must rent The Filth and The Fury and revel in musics failure as a world changing polemic
1,The English Patient can rightly be compared to the films of David Lean whose sweeping epics such as Lawrence of Arabia and Bridge on the River Kwai must have inspired the director Anthony Minghella The film is beautifully photographed and like Lawrence is set in Northern Africa but during the second world war The story is complex but it boils down to a forbidden love between an opinionated and often difficult archeologist played by Ralph Fiennes and a married woman played by Kristin Scott Thomas  The story based on a novel by Michael Ondaatje is told in flashbacks by Fiennes Count Laszlo de Almasy  the titular character The fact that his name does not sound like hes English plays a key role in what unfolds He has been badly burned in a plane crash occurring just as the film opens and is being cared for back in Europe by Hana an army nurse played by Juliette Binoche What makes this story epic is the vast sweep across place and time and the development of characters beyond that of the two illfated lovers The film makes clear that true love and passion even with dreaded consequences can make life worth living or worth dying for If youre a romantic at heart and can appreciate a film without the standard happy endings and simple moral codes you may find that The English Patient speaks directly to you 
0,There is a reason why the world forgot these creatures they are dull This is a Hammer Production which means that whoever made this movie should be struck with a hammer several times if possible  and where it most hurts Most people put more thought into taking a dump than these idiots have put into making this movie Seriously nowÂ… The movie begins with some cavemen hunting an antelopething Now antelopes must have evolved a lot from those prehistoric times because they actually attack and kill people here After that its time to meet the rest of the tribe more bearded men some fashionmodels and even a couple of very old greyhaired grannies and grandpas These old geezers obviously never heard about cave people not surpassing the age of 30 they refused to bow to the will of both logic and prehistorical records so they remain alive One of the cavemen isnt bearded he is cleanshaven Not quite as cleanshaven as Tarzan The Lord of the Humanoid CleanShaven Ones Roaming the Jungle Since Childhood And Without a Razor but thereabouts What follows is the obligatory earthquakemoltenlava destruction sequence which causes a lot of our notsohairy friends to meet their doom It is interesting to note that before the earthquake the fashionmodels showed their breasts more After it they must have gotten shy or something because they covered their chests for a while maybe they were covered by ash so I mistakenly thought they were covered More action follows in the form of two fashionmodels wrestling in the sand the nextbest thing to female mudwrestling I suppose After a good deal of the desert has been crossed our blackhaired tribe meets  how else could it be  a blond tribe Yawn More spellbinding stuff follows There is that redhead fashionmodel who is bothered by seeing a caveteen kill a hedgehogthing There is also the scene of a woman dying at birth those cavefashionmodels are so frail Eventually we get to meet an even darker haired and skinned tribe ie an evil tribe One of them becomes a WWF champion after he actually beats a huge bearthing in a wrestling bout 123 and its done the bear is the loser We also witness a jealous caveman miraculously recover from two major injuries first he gets stabbed with a big spear into the thigh yet he walks away from that as if it were but a scratch Then he gets thrown off a cliff  onto a big rock  by the blond goodietwoshoes caveman yet he walks away from it as if he were thrown onto a giant sofa Its unclear in the end whether he dies from falling off an even higher cliff or from that voodoo doll being crushed Oh yes voodoo was used in prehistoric times by white tribes that live in the desert and whose females were fashionmodels Its always important to learn from movies The message of the movie is as insightful as it is educational cave people liked to fight for local power and they loved their fashionmodels too As if any selfrespecting caveman would fight to be leader of such a sorry bunch
1,My 3rdyear French classes always enjoyed this film very much In a multicultural innercity high school the film provided many subjects for discussion in French in class but I know a lot of discussion went on in English after class The most obvious is the relationship between ProtÃ©e and AimÃ©e compared to the one between ProtÃ©e and France I always mentioned that I felt this film had one of the sexiest scenes I had ever seen in a movie One year a 17yearold AfricanAmerican shouted Yes when he figured out the scene the one where ProtÃ©e is helping AimÃ©e lace up her evening dress all the while both are examining the reflection of the other in the mirror Directors use the mirror technique when then want to focus on the inner conflict on the part of one or more character in a scene this is a perfect example of the technique and it is sexy Most students had trouble understanding the end of the film One suggested that one theme of the movie was Africanism and that no matter how much one loved Africa or Africans one cannot become African like the driver tried to do one must BE African
0,I am a lover of bad movies I own ROTOR and Boa vs Python and am working to build up my collection to such great titles as Troll 2 and Whats up Superdoc But Storm Trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies Its just lame The guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right Everything about this movie is stupid When the robot guy runs into the car it seems almost as if he knew it was going to blow up there was just no reason he would ever run in that direction Judge Jury and Executioner The perfect copbut they went too far I mean come on why do people bother making these movies anymore ROTOR makes it because it is hysterically awful but Storm Trooper is just a waste of cinema because it isnt even bad enough to be so bad its worth watching This belongs in someones home movies collection something they can be sort of proud of but that is all I am pssed off it was on an HBO channel with only 1star which is why I watched it because it didnt belong there Even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie It is shameful
0,After finally viewing this movie in its entirety I am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike Is it the worst Western ever No I wouldnt say that But the last great American Western a phrase I saw applied to it more than once Not even close A movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clichÃ©d that Ive ever seen The movie can be measured in groaners per minute as in how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life Theres so many instances of this that its distracting Cheesy lines come at you in waves predictable unoriginal and often  If bad dialogue doesnt bother you then how about bad gunfights Few Westerns can show you gunfighting thats completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously Its okay if theres a comic edge to such gunfighting such as in Silverado but in Tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good Westerns The final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score but by then I was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving Other than those flaws I can say the visuals are stunning  the movies well shot and the settings all look great The acting is passable especially considering what the actors were given to work with However if youre looking for the last great American Western do yourself a favor  go rent Unforgiven instead 3 out of 10
0,Very bad acting and a very shallow story Not even a decent BMovie Events that were suposed to be shocking like humans geting on board an alien ship were boring and very lame This is one of the worst scifi Ive ever seen I saw the 50 stars and decided to watch it since i like the genre but it sucked so bad Now theres really very few good movies on ALIEN subject I think because most of them are low budget I give it 310
0,This early Pia Zadora vehicle followed a familiar Harold Robbins formula ambitious main character wallows in decadence while pursuing the path to the top of some randomly chosen but glamorous world in this case the movie industry But despite being so formulaic as to be completely predictable this movie manages at the same time to be completely unbelievable Zadora to call her inexperienced as an actress is to be charitable never convinces as a screenwriter One would expect a movie about moviemaking to have some insights into its own industry and creative process But the script gives her none of the qualities which make writers interesting movie characters observance skill with words a lovehate relationship with ones own creative abilities Her character is as empty as a donut hole And this is just a taste of the incompetence on display here The cinematography is so murky that it is sometimes hard to see what is happening And the scenes never really hang together so everything seems like a succession of random moments at bad Hollywood parties Avoid
1,I havent seen the original Incredible Journey since I was a child so I cant really compare the two versions This version tells the story of three animals two dogs and a cat whose owners leave them with friends in the countryside when the father of the family has to take a new job in San Francisco The pets believing that they have been abandoned escape and set out on a long homeward journey through wilderness This story might have been most easily filmed as a cartoon but both versions are in fact liveaction films made using real animals One major difference is that in the later version the animals speak in human voices giving each its own distinct personality something that was not done in the original film A similar device of talking animals has been used in other recent childrens films such as Racing Stripes Some critics have been rather sniffy about the use of this device but my own view is that giving the animals distinctive personalities of their own helps to strengthen the film rather than weaken it The animals were voiced by bigname stars Don Ameche Michael J Fox and Sally Fields Both dogs are male and their relationship parallels that between many humans in buddybuddy movies Shadow a golden retriever is the wise experienced older dog Chance the younger one is brash cocky and impulsive To British eyes Chance looks like a boxer but is actually an American Bulldog which is apparently a different breed to its British cousin Sassy the cat is female with a rather prim and proper personality She is very proud of her status as a cat which in her eyes makes her vastly superior to any mere dog Cats rule dogs drool From an adult viewpoint the film has a number of faults it can be sentimental some of the incidents such as the one in which the animals manage to catapult a mountain lion into the river are quite incredible and the human characters are all completely forgettable This however is a film which is mainly aimed at children and I suspect they will enjoy it immensely Certainly any animalloving child will do so Comments by some professional critics such as James Berardinelli who complained that the animals voices lessened the films grandeur only serve to strengthen my view that professional critics are not always the best guides to childrens movies I doubt if many playground conversations about Homeward Bound concentrated on its supposed grandeur One thing adults will appreciate is the photography of Californias Sierra Nevada mountains They may also appreciate the films blend of humour and excitement as the runaway pets encounter perils such as bears mountain lions and porcupines in the wilderness This is a very enjoyable family film 710
0,Banned as a Video Nasty in the UK Unhinged has naturally gained quite a bit of notoriety However the most shocking thing I found about the film was its amateurishness in all departments The bloodletting I could handle the terrible acting shoddy editing awful direction lousy script and abysmal soundtrack were much harder to take Three girls on their way to a music festival crash into a ravine during a storm They are rescued by a friendly stranger who takes them to a nearby house The owner of the house a batty old lady and her spinster daughter welcome the girls in allowing them to stay for a few days in order to recuperate However someone doesnt want the girls to leaveÂ—ever One by one they fall victim to an unseen assailant Taking a long time to get going and featuring some of the worst performances ever in a horror film and that takes some doing Unhinged is a truly awful film The music is a total mess it sounds like a three year old has been let loose on a synthesiser and as such it complements the movie perfectly Only a couple of bloody scenes towards the end and a bit of gratuitous nudity save Unhinged from getting the lowest possible score If you are a horror completist and unfortunately I am you will want to see this in order to tick it off the Video Nasty watchlist But be warnedÂ—it is really really bad
1,This may not be a memorable classic but it is a touching romance with an important theme that stresses the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating career and life consequences for any unfortunate individual lacking this vital skill The story revolves around Iris a widow who becomes acquainted with a fellow employee at her factory job an illiterate cafeteria worker named Stanley Iris discovers that Stanley is unable to read and after he loses his job she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen Of course as you might predict the two although initially wary of involvement develop feelings for each other Jane Fonda competently plays Iris a woman with problems of her own coping with a job lacking prospects two teenage children one pregnant an unemployed sister and her abusive husband However Robert DeNiro is of course brilliant in his endearing portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful but illiterate Stanley bringing a dignity to the role that commands respect They arent your typical charming young yuppie couple as generally depicted in on screen romances but an ordinary working class middle aged pair with pretty down to earth struggles I wont give the ending away but its a lovely heartwarming romance and a personal look into the troubling issue of adult illiteracy albeit from the perspective of a fictional character
1,This was playing at our theater in Amsterdam and the film we wanted to see was soldout so we went to this not knowing anything about it other than it was a documentary about the planet We were very happy at our misfortune as this was a very powerful film about life and the delicate balance we all share with the rest of the inhabitants of Earth This film has some of the most breathtaking photography I have ever seen in a film and took me places from deserts to oceans to rain forests and displayed things I have never seen in a film TV or book Earth is a film that every student should see before they become jaded I will encourage my niece to see this film since she will be inheriting the planet we leave her This is also a film to see on a theater screen or a very big television since the photography is so powerful and exotic
0,Bloody Birthday is a totally rubbish slasher movie from beginning to end  I found the acting to be pretty good considering the genre of movie and its obvious low budget I dont know what was going on with the cinematography but it looked ghastly Way too oversaturated Maybe this is a bad transfer to DVD or maybe it always looked like that I dont know  There really are no redeeming qualities to speak of There are a few deaths but not really gory I wouldnt bother with it if I was you The best thing about the DVD was the 15 minute interview with producer Max Rosenberg who was very amusing and honest He didnt have anything good to say about director Ed Hunt and admits the movie was a failure but he would like to remake it as he believes it has a decent plot However he died in 2004 so I guess it will be up to someone else to take on that challenge With the way things have been going in the last few years it wouldnt surprise me theres at least one remake per week at the cinema these day It couldnt be any worse than the original I suppose but I couldnt care less whether it got remade or not
1,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen Its so full of details and every time you see it youll find new things Like then the father is in the shower but still only hears one voice and when the girls flute they cant do it at the same time cause then there would be two girls and there arent  I have some problem finding out about in the middle of the movie their Uncle visit them but why does his wife freak out Else a fantastic movie The best Asian movie ever I hope people will enjoy it There have been so many movie where the main character is skitso The machinist Secret Window and so on but this movie is way better than them
1,Count Laszlo Ralph Fiennes has just been transferred to a hospital in Italy during World War II He is horrifically burned from an ambush His nurse Hana Juliette Binoche tends to him body and mind for she fears quite rightly that he may be a very troubled soul In the course of his care the Count starts to tell Hana of his recent past It seems he worked in a government capacity in Africa where he met a beautiful married lady named Katherine Kristin Scott Thomas Although they tried to avoid each other they fell in love After a brief affair Katherine called it quits leaving the Count desolate Even so the two would meet again under heartwrenching circumstances Meanwhile Hana herself falls for a Sihk man in the British bomb squad Yet the war is raging relentlessly Can love exist when the world is in turmoil This is a tremendous film based on an equally fine but complex novel The plot has many story lines that are woven together beautifully each of them poignant beyond description The script itself is elegant and contains many memorable lines Fiennes is magnificent both as the burn victim and as the man who thought love was a myth Scott Thomas is also quite fine as the woman who fights against her passions As for Binoche she richly deserved the Oscar that she was presented as her nurse is a shining example of hope in a hopeless situation The scenery is utterly gorgeous as are the costumes the direction and the production If you have missed out on viewing this film rectify that soon very soon The English Patient will remain one of the greatest achievements in film for centuries to come
0,The 33 percent of the nations nitwits that still support W Bush would do well to see this movie which shows the aftermath of the French revolution and the terror of 1794 as strikingly similar to the post 911 sociopolitical landscape Maybe then they could stop worrying about saving face and take the awhupping they deserve Its really a shame that when a politician ruins the country those who voted for him cant be denied the right to ever vote again Theyve clearly shown they have no sense of character What really stands out in this movie is the ambiguity of a character as hopelessly doctrinaire as Robespierre a haunted empty man who simplistic reductive ideology cant help him elucidate the boundaries between safety and totalitarianism Execution and murder Selfdefense and patriotism His legalistic litmus tests aggravate the hopeless situation hes helped create Sound like any belligerent overprivileged retarded Yale cheerleaders you know of  Wojciech Pszoniak blows the slovenly Deparidieu off the screen As sympathetic as Robespierres plight is its comforting to know that shortly after the film ends hell have his jaw shot off and be sent to the guillotine
0,Its perfectly ok that people dies in an animation but there are just way too many death in this one Start from the very beginning the story is all around battles fights death and revenge It goes on and on for entire one and a half hour It was interesting at the beginning but I grew very tire after before the show was half way through Unlike other animations this one is lack of humor There are not many interactions between the characters either The good thing about it is the sword fight scene looks pretty good and the characters look nice
0,Just as the whole cast and crew knows f all about film making This film concerns the adventures and predicaments of a modern day cockney vampire assassin and an age old spat with her seemingly jaded vampire lover That plot in itself reeks of clichÃ©s and promises of boredom when on as small a scale a film as this and thats exactly what you get First off let me say that I by no means dismiss films because they are B movies in fact some of my favourite films are B movies such as Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter but this one misses the mark by a mile Anyone with any knowledge of small budget films will know that the acting is rarely gripping and emotional but Razor Blade Smile creates a whole new dimension of hamming it up on screen Some of the so called acting is just indescribably bad with characters spewing cheesy one liners that fall flat and discourse expressing about as much emotion and conviction as the terminator after a couple of horse tranquillisers A vast portion of the film is also taken up by the vampiric characters the protagonist in particular unnecessarily flapping their mouths showing off their ridiculously large vampire teeth and exhaling very loudly It literally must happen in almost every scene at least once and quickly became annoying and pointless as if that many looks of slack jawed supposedly scary vampire faces were used to merely fill a little bit of time and pad out the rest of this turd sandwich of a film Contrary to what some of the other reviewers believe on here I feel this film the director in particular is really trying to take this film seriously in many parts The sheer number of overly dramatic action shots and extreme closeups seems to indicate to me that the director really wanted people to feel this film and make it legitimate to its genre and not spoof it and he fails miserably The attempts at supposedly tasteful sex scenes come out as comic and silly and the action sequences are sometimes just plain stupid Also the ending of this film was one of the weakest and most pathetic conclusions I have seen to a film B movie or not When films such as this force you to sit through hours of themselves only to be rewarded with a oh it was all a game ending it is actually sickening It the conclusion to the plot feels like an afterthought of the director that he figured out on the last day of shooting because they had run to the end of their shoestring budget But I have not rated this film as one star despite the overwhelming crappiness and this is because of the only plus point I can really give this film Intentionally or not it was funny I am fairly sure the parts I found humorous were not intended to be and I found most of the efforts at genuine gags to be fruitless but when watched with friends it is a good film to take the mickey out of
0,You do realize that youve been watching the EXACT SAME SHOW for eight years right I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers coexist on an Island but youd think that after watching unkempt stinkladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original and interesting And Im not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record I find questionable Its just hard to suspend disbelief for Bushy Bill eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned makeshift biodome sipping frosty mochcinnos with moxy Whats the appeal here I dont care about these people or their meandering lives I just dont get it But if you DO find yourself being captivated by hairy unwashed people I suggest you turn off your TV and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their TRUE habitat They call them HOMELESS PEOPLE and free of charge you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters eventually striking paydirt and fashioning a homemade Dr Frankensteinstyled cancerstick all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of Aqua Velva on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise And the best part Much like Survivor every week one member of the tribe Leaves the Island when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local Institution when the frightening unmedicated state of fullblown schizophrenia kicks into gear Now THATS ENTERTAINMENT
0,Weve been served  a terrible film Okay Ill admit that since Im white and have had no practical experience in the competitive world of stepdancing I might not exactly be an authority on this type of film On the other hand I do know a bad motion picture when I see it And boy have I just seen it Filmed in LowBudgetVision and directed by Ian Iqubal Rashid A Touch of Pink How She Move tells the tale of how important it is to follow ones dreams  even if those dreams include bopping around to loud irritating hiphop music and speaking dialogue the average person would not understand if he or she had an international translator Ill try to give a small synopsis of the plot First of all there are two actors that look like LL Cool J who work in an auto shop in Toronto the Mecca of racial diversity but still have time to practice dancing for eight hours a day  There are a few other guys in this crew including a token white dude and a guy that looks like Denzel Washington in Malcolm X There are also two women in the movie  one resembles Serena Williams and the other looks like Geraldine from the old Flip Wilson Show One of these ladies was kicked out of a private college because her parents spent all of her tuition on a drugaddicted sibling The other girl a member of Salt N Pepa no doubt is just plain no good Theres another guy who looks like Eddie Murphys Buckwheat while still another actor whos a Huggy Bear knockoff These guys are rival step dancers Evidently this activity is very hardcore in the hood and they are all practicing for the big Step Monster jam in Detroit Since I was unable to understand 90 percent of the dialogue perhaps some subtitles would have been useful as in a Bergman film or that one music video by Snow its hard to explain what happens other than theres a lot of arguing the Serena Williams girl who never smiles by the way becomes a freelance stepper moving from group to group theres some stepdancing and a lot of irritating hiphop music Its a typical ragstoriches story sort of like Rocky with a really bad soundtrack Rudy with annoying rap music in the background Cry Freedom without the laughs  But why does a film  which could have made a big impact on black audiences  have to contain drug addiction bad parents and a title that sounds like a firstgrader saying the phrase How she moves I was moved by this movie however Moved to leave the theater as quickly as possible
0,I dont know why all the previous comments are approval of this movie IT IS  well not by far butTHE SUCKIEST MOVIE IVE SEEN LATELY full of clichÃ©s bad acting actually novery bad acting and has a silly plotIf I would have seen it in a cinema I would have walked out after the first 20 minutes I f you hate somebody  make himher watch this moviethats how bad it is A girl who has an imaginary boyfriend that gives up a relationship with a real one because her imagination is jealousbut i think it figuresshe takes after her parents who also have some mental issuesplus the character who is supposed to be I think the laughing stock of it the thing that should make you laugh cals room mate is a serious nut case and just makes me feel sorry for himand the whole movie
1,OK Is Barney the best childrens show of all time Of course not But in some of the comments left by other members of IMDb you would think it was a multi million dollar production with high class actors and a ridiculous budget for special effects Well guess what Its Barney for Gods sake He shows children good behavior good manors and that its OK to be who you are For those of you who find him annoying that is because you are not five years old and the show was not meant for you To the IMDb member who wrote the review on the first page I think you may have gone a little too far Did you actually describe a Sesame Street character as down to Earth Grow up everyone this is a great show for preschoolers and actually does help children learn in a fun and creative way
1,Gentle and genial film seems to have been overlooked as a trivialityand to be fair the narrative is a bit tenuous and lightweight as dramabut I feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes depicting the first impact of a new art on an alien and sceptical society have a radiance and naturalness which capture the century long romance between cinema and audience better than any film in years Immensely sympathetic performance from Jared Harriss who seems to have inherited all of his fathers charismahopefully without poor Richards penchant for hellraising and haminessand charming offbeat cuteness from costar Yu Xia combine to make this a real heartwarmer Radiant location photography including glowingly beautiful scenes at the great wall and sensitive direction by Ann Hu give film added impact In short a must for anyone ever enchanted by a shadow flickering to lifeand making magic in the dark
0,Steven Seagal movies have never been Oscar material but with each passing release they get worse and worse This one starts with Seagal getting picked up by the FBI because he killed a few people in self defence hes active military so is saved from jail to rescue a stolen Stealth plane that will be used by the clichÃ© evil English villain that Hollywood is so obsessed with including these days Suffice to say the film has terrible dialog that is almost always delivered with a hefty topping of cheese and lack of acting talent The story isnt interesting and there are segments of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story characters of movie as a whole such as the lesbian interaction between the two main females in the cast which is there purely for titilation to get viewers and yet isnt even titilating just confusing as it makes no sense as to why it happened when it didnt need to In short a terrible script with bad dialog delivered by subpar actors boring and at times badly choreographed action scenes and nonrelevant parts that only serve to achieve the nearimpossible and make the movie even worse Save 98 minutes of your life and give this miss even if you are Seagals most ardent fan
1,This show is freaking hilarious the jokes are original god and i Love Eric and Kelso yeah i know what they say after the 8th season its not funny anymore because Eric and Kelso are no longer in the show and Randy is a real dumbass Randy is comparing to Eric and Kelso  you cant take the funniest characters and switch em with Im a cool guy kind of guy Randy it isnt his fault anyway but the writers are trying to keep the 8th season funny its still is not as much as the earlier seasons but its alright the 360s are awesome the circle Red is a real kind of mentalabusing dad  and kitty is always halfhigh halfpie Hyde tries to be cool all the time he has his moments too the least favrioutes characters are Jackie and Donna theyre cool but not without Kelso and Eric great show Dumbass
1,Whether this movie is propaganda or not I firmly believe it is not it really shows the power of Media The importance of this documentary is not to show how good of a man Chavez is It is really to demonstrate the way the Bolivarians saw how it happened the Chavez way of seeing it Although it may seem wrong and bias to support a film  I think the point of view shown in the movie is utterly legitimate The Venezuelian people via the private media corporation of Venezuela only saw a one side perspective of the coup the NeoLiberal side This movie shows us the way the Bolivarians saw it  Call it propaganda  I say its a judgment call on your part
0,Have you seen all the big adventures of last few decades If you have dont bother with this one as youve already seen most of the scenes already  and I can guarantee that those scenes were originally in much better movies The story Im sure that true storytellers will never forgive me is childish and stupid stupid in a way that making it play in a mortuary would result in a bunch of angry walking dead Every character is based in a clichÃ© and well theyre nothing but the clichÃ© And yes again all you need to be a hero is to be American At least in Finland they advertised this to be the kind of movie the DVD was made for Maybe I should sell my player then 110
0,SPOILERS Im always surprised at how many people gave this game good reviews It was awful The script and voice acting alone ruined it Gabriel and Grace are the most unlikeable characters in the game You almost pray for their deaths And worst of all there are less vampires in this game than there were werewolves in The Beast Within The lack of real vampires was incredibly disappointing If youre expecting some kind of Anne Rice style vampire story forget it This games story has very little to do with vampires You wont even see any till about the very end and even then you wont get to fight them The story has radical and pretty much blasphemous views of Christianity Im amazed it got off the drawing board Im not even Christian and I found it offensive Mostly the story centers around a search for The Holy Grail and buried treasure The kidnapping of a royal baby which should have been the focus really gets pushed aside There is no sense of urgency for Gabriel to find the baby In fact he almost never asks anyone about the baby after the first few time blocks The graphics are pretty bad The characters move about at a snails pace even on the best of systems They are chunky and outdated And its hard to go from the FMV of The Beast Within to this horrible game engine for Blood of the Sacred The relationship between Gabriel and Grace takes an awful turn too I really dont know why it was so horribly rushed but they do sleep together And its not fun Gabriel spends most of the game telling his best friend Mosely how he thinks of Grace as more of a sister and he doesnt think shes the one for him And he seems really grossed out that they slept together But hes so unlikeable throughout the game that you almost dont even care at that point His dialogue was the worst in the game And he was constantly making stupid sexual innuendos at anything female the entire game By the end of the game Grace leaves him with what appears to be a Dear John letter I guess she was as fed up with him as most of the players were I found the story to be annoying and boring I was expecting to play a story of a royal baby who was kidnapped by vampires And I was expecting to get to see and fight vampires maybe even have Gabriel or Grace turn into one But no Instead the story focused on the authors warped vision of Christianity What a shame Here they had the elements for a great adventure and instead we got this For me the only interesting parts of the game were actually at the very end We do get a few action style puzzles at the end But it wasnt worth suffering through the entire game to get to them I cant really recommend this game I had gotten it back when it came out years ago and I hated the game engine so much that I shelved it for years I only recently dusted it off to see what Id been missing And now Im very sorry that I did My favorite characters were ruined I hope there will be a fourth game just to redeem the series And I hope they get it right next time It would be a terrible shame to end the series with this installment
0,A previous IMDb reviewer has stated that Rafter Romance is a ripoff thats the other reviewers term of a German musical called Me By Day You By Night Apparently that reviewer is unaware that both of these films have borrowed their premise from Box and Cox an English play written by John Maddison Morton in 1847 This play deals with two tradesmen who rent the same room from an unscrupulous landlady each man believing himself the sole tenant Because the two men have different work schedules the ruse is not discovered straight away This play was once so popular in Britain that to Box and Cox it became a common term for an arrangement in which two people willingly shared accommodations meant for only one person The innovation of Rafter Romance and its predecessor is that the two tenants are now a man and a woman who inevitably develop a romance As is usual in these cornball movies the guy and the gal detest each other until they fall into each others arms Hoo boy The landlord in this film is played by George Sidney a character actor who specialised in playing Jewish stereotypes that were meant to be sympathetic George Sidney was never as annoying as the odious Harry Green the Jewish equivalent of Stepin Fetchit but Sidneys depictions of Jewish characters are still exaggerated and embarrassing to watch The single most notable thing about Rafter Romance is that to my knowledge this is the earliest Hollywood film to make reference to Hitler and the rise of Nazism At one point in this movie landlord Eckbaum Sidney discovers his teenage son Julius engaged in chalking swastikas on the walls Eckbaum and his son are clearly meant to be Jewish Admittedly nobody in Hollywood in 1933 had any real idea of what Hitler was planning for the Jews in Europe  still its surprising to see a film depicting a Jewish teenager who thinks that swastikas are a joke His father is quite properly angered by this display of the Nazi symbol A very shameful aspect of Hollywood history is the documented fact that all of the major Hollywood studios continued to do business with the Third Reich as late as 1939 Hollywoods leading ladies were medically documented as Aryan so that their films could be distributed in Nazi Germany and Austria For the same reason Hollywoods leading men were documented as Aryan and uncircumcised Except for Darryl Zanuck at Twentieth CenturyFox all the Hollywood studio executives who colluded in this policy were Jewish  but clearly had no objection to doing business with Hitler Im surprised that Rafter Romance contains a scene depicting swastikas unfavourably as this sequence would have rendered the film Verboten in Germany and Austria Maybe the scene was cut out for German release it isnt crucial to the movies plot Apart from this the movie contains nothing notable Robert Benchley does his usual unfunny befuddled characterisation Ive never understood the appeal of this man Ill rate Rafter Romance 4 out of 10
1,Watch on the Rhine is one of the best antinazi propaganda films made during World War Two Paul Lukas was certainly deserving of his Oscar Bette Davis shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was I would recommend this film to those interested in that era and of course the fabulous films of the late great Ms Bette Davis
0,BottomoftheFreddy barrel This is the worst film in the series beating Freddys Revenge for that title A cheaplooking with mediocre special effects incoherent mess with Freddy turned into a punster He has one or two cool lines but that doesnt save this illogical and sloppy sequel
0,Oh my god this movie is incredible its the baddest movie ever and I know what I am talking about I am a scary movies fan The story is totally silly a group of adults decide to make a party and a silly guy with an awful mask comes and kills everybody the dialogs are a kind of parody worst theyre just talking about sex with a so bad accent The end is oh discover by yourself you will be really really surprised not possible yes it is and surprise the movie is just 58minutes not possible bis yes it is Worst than House IV and Howling V To put it in a nutshell forget it forever
0,Hopelessly inept and dull movie in which the characters stand around in rooms or a rocket ship and talk endlessly You might think things would perk up when they explore Mars but these scenes are filmed through a heavy redorange filter which makes everything very murky The Martian landscapevegetation consists mainly of drawings and the monsters are entirely unconvincing There are echoes of Bride Of The Monster when the heroine carefully winds the octopus like tentacle of a flesh eating plant around her before weakly thrashing about the difference being that the Ed Wood film is a hundred times more entertaining Better wear earplugs when watching otherwise the scifi music score repeated endlessly will drive you insane If you find yourself unable to sleep one night just slip this one into the VCR and your insomnia will be cured in no time
0,This film fails on many many levels The script is the first failing and as I understand it if the script stinks theres nothing that can fix that The plot is boring after the first 45 minutes Im looking at the counter on the DVD saying to myself how much longer The cinematography is pretty awful Im not sure how bad the transfer was to DVD but it looked like a VHS copy Also the sound was bad I realize this isnt going to get remixed for 51 but yikes it didnt even sound like it was in Dolby Stereo which had been around for almost a decade when they cut this film Slipstream was far too similar to both Mad Max and Blade Runner for comfort Because of the lack of decent special effects and high quality dialog it is extremely disappointing If I recall the pointer scene took place during the last 20 minutes usually it should take place in the first 20 Most people will be totally confused as to what the heck is going on until the final 20 minutes The films music was excellent in parts and then completely inappropriate in others Elmer Bernstien did the scoring but it sounds like someone else had a hand in sticking in other stuff elsewhere as it doesnt match the overall good orchestral score with some synthesizer music There were great actors cast Bob Peck Mark Hamill Ben Kingsley Bill Paxton And they did a great job breathing the little available life into their characters Well Paxtons character was pretty stupid and the whole movie was centered on him Im not sure a heroic stooge is a good choice for the main character who carries the film Again a major flaw with the script Thank goodness I watched this from a mail order DVD service and not the theater Overall a major disappointment for Scifi fans or fans of Paxton or Hamill 90 minutes of your life youll never get back
0,This movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel quirky and obnoxious characters a few quirky town with quirky folk a quirky coffee shop or restaurant coffee shop here lots of shots of canadian stuff for postcards ocean stuff here lots of mention of gotta get out of this town downright booooring And it succeeds on all counts Something to note though I couldnt figure out whether this movie was just trying to be postNorthern Exposure quirky comedy or something surreal like a druginduced or psychotic hallucination The editing of this movie jumped around nonsensically from one unrelated thing to another with zero pacing or motivation Not to mention the fact that half the time we didnt even know where we were jumping Take for instance the very opening shots of yelling teens in a car Who are they and what the h did they have to do with anything And this sub  uh  plot use that word plot loosely concering kids that seem to span generations I dont think they actually do but the editing makes it look like they materialize from flashback all of a sudden to current time Huh What did I miss Avoid Unless for laughs Or you want to try and trip out on the inept editing
0,This film was the worst film I have ever seen It was a complete waste of money If I had not been in the cinema was my two young cousins who also thought it was disappointing but not as terrible as I thought I would have left the cinema There were two points in the film that I almost laughed but the rest of it was either boring ridiculous or painful I thought it would be a spoof on all superhero movies which I love but in fact it was mainly based on Spiderman with a few oblique references to other superhero movies such as Fantastic Four and Batman I really cannot think of one good thing to say about this film Do not waste your money with this filmthere are many other better films out there
1,i think the team behind this film did a very good job with the limitations they had only Â£300000 and 7 weeks to write film and edit the whole thing which i think is an achievement in itself although this film is not for the masses as a young innocent teenage girl is killed and there is homoeroticism involved in the story i think that this film is a heart wrenching tragedy and the more deeply involved you get in the story the more sadness you feel more so towards Heaton because of the love he feels but is not returned this is one of my favourite British films that i enjoyed very much and would watch again i think that its a shame that is film is not very well heard of at all
0,Oh my Poor Jane must have done the old rollingoverinthegrave thing Even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad Whatever else you do with Austen the dialog should sparkle even in this perhaps her most serious work and melodrama should be strictly out of bounds Alas not the case with this production By the time you get to Annes Frederick Frederick Frederick youll either be laughing or crying Unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of Austens work you can skip this one If you do watch it however there are small consolations The actresses playing Annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles
1,I instantly fell in love with Pushing Daisies This show manages to put a smile on my face with its great storytelling witty dialog and great acting But thats not all It also manages to keep you until the end The basic idea behind the show  Bringing people back to life with one touch ending the undead status with a second  is interesting and could still be in later seasons But the suspenseful murder cases the unique look of the show and the highly proficient narrator add to the experience But Pushing Daisies is more than its parts It has a certain charm that I really enjoy and Im looking forward to enter the world of Ned and Chuck for a second season
0,I hate guns and have never murdered anyone but when even half of the events that take place in Shuttle happen to you or close ones and you find a gun YOU SHOOT YOUR ATTACKER THREE TIMES FIVE TIMES Whatever makes the pulse stop on them and increase on you I think even God would say Good call In a very Hosteltype film but more realistic Â– as this really could happen to anyone well if youre a pretty young woman that is Â– Shuttle was a decent film though on the long side A few good shocks always call AAA even just to change a tire basically just one surprise but for the most part you could see things coming And aside from the typical tie him up instead of the previously mentioned shooting him the most annoying part was the revelation towards the closing from one best friend to the other Getting past those its enjoyable for what it is Basically we have two unsuspecting females traveling alone from Mexico home wow thats original and one lost her luggage preventing them from leaving the airport until late And after an obvious foreshadowed signlanguage scene they enter a toogoodtobetrue halfprice shuttle ride ClichÃ©d jocks previously introduced con their way on the shuttle to join what appears to be Alan Rucks stunt double from Speed From here its obvious what happens I did mention it was a Hostel knock off but still I didnt find too much horrible yet nothing spectacular Though it wouldve served the audience better with roughly 1520 minutes deleted I would recommend if you have almost 2 hours to kill and are into sick horror
0,Im glad some people liked this but I hated this film It had a very good idea for a story line but thats where it ended It was badly written badly acted and badly made  It had some interesting plot points but they were just skipped over too fast the writers needed to realize what to keep in and expand on these bits like lying about why she was kidnapped and ditch the dross Instead it was whats going on 5 seconds later they tell you This film had no suspense and I was bored from start to end I just wanted it to finish  Go and rent misery or best laid plans if you want suspense or twists that keep you guessing to the end
0,It is way beyond me how this script was ever sold much less produced and distributed The dialogue was so bad it was sickening The train and helicopter scenes appeared to have been done on flash cards by high school students Lou Diamond Phillips must have hidden under his seat when this  this movie was shown at a private screening afterwhich he most likely left by the back door The only emotion it aroused in me was pity for the cast they had to bite the bullet to get through this one I couldnt stand to watch all of it it was so predictable that it was funny Who knows maybe it will be picked up by one of the networks as a situation comedy
1,I know that to include everything in the book the film would have to have been several hours long so I think they did their best to include things that were crucial and pivotal to the story I thought the casting was great the children who played Amir and Hassan were very good actors And the guy who played Amir as an adult was great The scenes between him and Baba were especially touching I thought the locations they used were interesting scenes set in Afghanistan were shot in China and one scene that took place in Fremont CA the graduation scene was actually shot on Treasure Island in San Francisco I worked one day as an extra on Kite Runner and it was that day the day they shot the graduation scene We reported to Treasure Island in the morning they checked everyones wardrobe to make sure it looked like the late 80s an then we took our places in the audience They shot the scene over and over again until they were happy with it It was cool to see the actors up close and also to see the books author who was on hand as a story consultant I thought this book was excellent and I recommend both the book and the movie to anyone This is a moving story about friendship love guilt and eventual redemption There is a way to be good again
1,Always enjoy the great acting talents of Harry HamlinJim LansfordStrange Hearts01 who plays a straight as an arrow husband who seems to get all kinds of attention from very charming young women namely Lisa ZaneLynneMonkeybone01 who is a coworker with Jim Lansford and you wonder why he doesnt try to hit on her for some fun Annie PottsKris LansfordBreaking the Rules92is a very warm and sweet loving wife to Jim and has complete trust in her husband Kris wants to always keep her husband happy and even buys him a home with out him even seeing it for himself This film will keep you guessing right to the very END
0,I wish I could use the time travel machine to jump back to the moment I considered seeing this movie and make other plans instead I saw a free screening of A Sound of Thunder so I cant complain about the price but I wish I could get my 103 minutes refunded The acting was mediocre and the special effects were deplorable People shouldnt make movies about dinosaurs if they cant afford to make the prehistoric creatures look as good or better than those in Jurassic Park Spielberg spoiled us Edward Burns as Travis Ryer was the movies only saving grace I noticed that females under 18 rated the movie the highest and the only explanation is that they ogled over Burns the whole time The whole long 103 minutes This movie should have been over in about 80 minutes It just dragged on and on and on Dont waste your time or your money on this farfetched flick
1,The Great Dictator is a beyondexcellent film Charlie Chaplin succeeds in being both extremely funny and witty and yet at the same time provides a strong statement in his satire against fascism The antiNazi speech by Chaplin at the end with its values is one of filmdoms great moments Throughout this movie I sensed there was some higher form of intelligence beyond genuinely intelligent filmmaking at work
0,Seeing the names of the starring actors Statham Snipes and Phillippe I thought that the movie should at least be decently funny or interesting Instead all I got from it was not just boring 92 minutes but the frustration of knowing everything that was about to happen and hearing tons of lame and shabby bad cop phrases The main problem is that the movie doesnt have a good story to begin with And when you have that than no one can help you not Statham not Wesley Snipesnot even John McClane could save this movie  It could be cool for the kids if they arent over 12 years of age because they dont care so much about the story and there are some big explosions in the movie
1,When I saw this movie I was stunned by what a great movie it was This is the only movie I think I would ever give a 10 star rating I am sure this movie will always be in my top 5 The acting is superb Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are at their best I dont think anyone could have a better job than Kate  If it is a rainy day and you cant decide what to rent well this is the one You will love all the acting special effects and much much more If you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now You wont regret it 
0,WARNING Some spoilers included though it is a documentary I bought this documentary because I like the work of the directors DA Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus which includes MOON OVER Broadway STARTUPCOM and THE WAR ROOM all terrific documentaries I would highly recommend Watching this ultimately boring and uninsightful account from Depeche Modes 1988 tour I realized they had nothing to work with when they went to edit this film together The band members were certainly less than forthcoming oncamera hence undoubtedly the contest to add fans on a oneweek bus trip was added to liven things up a bit Really now I mean cmon Who thought a concert film of a synthpop band with three keyboardists and a singer would be a good idea Granted I like Depeche Modes music and Martin Gore writes good melodies but seeing them in concert never seemed like it would be interesting and this movie is proof positive Unless you are a HUGE fan of Depeche Mode stay away from this documentaryits a complete waste of time
0,Youve heard it said to live every moment as if its your last Whether its your last day or not I beg you not to waste any part of it watching this Nichole Hiltz provides some nice moments of eye candy that alas stays wrapped and David DeLuise shows why he should stick to the small screen or dog food commercials A shallow unrealistic plot with dreadful dialogue means there is no Art in the Art of Revenge 
0,What an utter disappointment The score of 61 here on IMDb built up some mild expectations but oh my was I disappointed The first thing that bugs me are those braindead stereotyped university kids Yes I know teens can be childish and so on but why are they in movies always portrayed as complete braindead morons There was one character that I thought was alright but heshe not revealing it here was killed off way before the end The other characters was poorly executed and even the supposed heroheroine just didnt do it for me On the plus side The plot is pretty good and the productions values a cut above for these kind of flicks The acting was generally not very good Rutger Hauer stands out in a small role But it all fails with bland and braindead characters You just stop caring about them after 10 minutes 410 and thats being generous
0,This is a baffling film  The beauty in sexual relations between men and women is shown degraded by a set of men and women who can only be described as a collection of oddballs and misfits Greenaway acknowledges his inspiration to Fellinis film 8 12 but whereas Fellini is a titan of world cinema Greenaway is not He has none of the maestros lightness of touch nor his ability to convey feelings and emotions with a deftness of clarity He is pretentious the film being divided into chapters with a written introduction to each as if the viewer has to be guided into the film except that the written notices only stay on screen for a few seconds not long enough to be read by the audience with the result that they are mostly ignored As for the women only two can be described as lookers Palmira played by Polly Walker and Giaconda played by Natacha Amal The rest ooze with ordinariness Both the women and the men retreat from the harsh light of reality into the dim shades of fantasy Greenaway obviously wants to make the point that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness The women themselves are depressing since they render their services in exchange for money Relations between men and women are debased into a commercial transaction There is no sense of joy or happiness or love in the film indeed there are several scenes that are deeply unpleasant  The suggestion of an incestuous relationship between father and son Philip and Storey Emmental played respectively by John Standing and Matthew Delamere The callous disregard of both men that Giaconda is carrying their child she in fact gets pregnant twice the first foetus being aborted and the second time she is sent away to a destination chosen by the men from a flight book Both men having sex with a woman who has no legs the half woman in the title The beastiality that exists between Beryl played by Amanda Plummer with a pig named Hortense Father and son sharing women between them Women enjoying being beaten sexually The father sleeping with the corpse of his dead wife Mercifully none of these scenes are shown sexually only hinted at The hinted degradation of women is such that there cannot be any wonder that the film was booed at when it was first premiered at Cannes What is more extraordinary is that the actresses in the film lined up to defend it showing yet again that there is no limit to the naivety of women and that women will fool themselves into being exploited by men Greenaways directorial style is pretentious it is a triumph of style over substance a depiction of Film as Art accompanied by the abandonment of common sense Greenaway tries to attain the sublimity of surrealism but only succeeds in showing the banality of human relationships
0,Ridiculous This movie is actually a vehicle for the Ramtha School of Enlightenment If you are wondering who the bleep Ramtha is Ramtha is a 35000 yearold spiritwarrior who appeared in JZ Knights kitchen in Tacoma Washington in 1977 Knight claims that she is Ramthas channel She also owns the copyright to Ramtha and conducts sessions in which she pretends to go into a trance and speaks Hollywoods version of Elizabethan English in a guttural husky voice She has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars performing as Ramtha at seminars 1000 a crack and at her Ramtha School of Enlightenment and from the sales of tapes books and accessories Clark and Gallo 1993 She must have hypnotic powers Searching for selffulfillment otherwise normal people obey her command to spend hours blindfolded in a cold muddy doorless maze John Wheeler one of Americas finest theoretical physicists would roll his eyes about this movie He has in the recent past criticized parapsychologists for their misuse and misinterpretations of quantum theory This movie does the same thing as those fools There is a great review of this movie at Skeptico I recommend anyone considering watching this movie read it first before contributing to a cults coffers httpskepticoblogscomskeptico200504whatthebleephtml I noticed one reviewer here at IMDb say to take this movie with a grain of salt It will take enough salt to kill a horse to wade through the garbagethinking of this movie
1,I was delighted when I saw that my husband rented Labyrinth of Passion I love Almodovars films We both loved the movie We both couldnt stop laughing We especially enjoyed the scene in which the transvestite is shooting a photo novel and while supposedly being menaced by a killer with an electric drill is told to answer the phone and say I cant talk to you right now Im being attacked by a sadistic serial killer If I survive I will call you back That would make a great answering machine message come to think of it We also loved the lady telling her new found beloved I went to an orgy after the concert but I couldnt stop thinking of you Im waiting to use that line on Twitter Labyrinth of Passion is a rollicking farce with plenty of high jinks hilarious dialog and eye candy for everyone The film has aged well the 1980s costumes and hairdos add to the wackiness I would give it a 10 out of 10 rating but I am giving it a 8 for two reasons The first is the scene which involves laxatives which includes a shot of a lady soiling herself totally unnecessary and it brings down the tone of the film to Hollywood grossout comedy for a moment The second is the suggestion that Queti is sleeping with her father shocking yes but again it ruins the tone of the film Still I would recommend the film to anyone who wants a sophisticated spicy and fun time
0,This movie is hilarious The problem is that its not a comedy One classic scene involves Kurt Thomas just happening to find a pommelhorse in the middle of a village square which he uses to pummel the bad guys Another is the trek into the Village of Crazies Too bad this movie wasnt made to be a farce or it may have gotten better ratings
1,1st watched 10102009  8 out of 10 Dir  Billy Wilder Spectacular rendering of Lindberghs famous flight by James Stewart as Lindbergh and Director Billy Wilder There isnt really a whole lot of background built into this story but thats OK because Wilder makes the event really remarkable as it comes directly from Lindberghs perspective since he used his book as the basis of the movie This early movie about flying has to be one of the best about the act itself as well Stewart talking and thinking to himself during the flight gives you so much insight into what Lindbergh went thru in this 33 hour solo flight across the Atlantic And he did the whole flight without sleeping the night before  which is amazing There is a little backstory about how he purchased the plane and got the financing and some flashbacks about his life during the flight but the movie is mostly about the flight The story is also beautifully made and photographed and is a joy to watch despite its age I appreciate the fact that they didnt throw in a lot of fluff and just let the story tell itself Well done throughout This is a classic movie that should be viewed by all
1,This movie really proves that the world is all too often an unfair place especially the world of motion pictures The Assignment received barely any attention upon its release and not surprisingly flopped at the boxoffice but when history will be written this movie will most surely receive some long lost praise Thank God Im surrounded by friends who knows whats good for me Being a movie buff like myself a pal highly recommended The Assignment a movie I hadnt even heard about I decided to check out what Leonard Maltin gave it and not surprisingly he gave it 12 Knowing that this is the same grade he gave classics like Alien The Usual Suspects and The Matrix I kid you not I knew his meaning didnt mean diddly squat jack s So without hesitating I went out and bought it on DVD This was about 3 years ago and the movie is still one of my proudest belongings in my DVD collection despite a cover design that echoes a low budget stinker with Casper Van Dien The Assignment is expertly directed delivering some really intense moments that will hold you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie on top of that it boasts an at times brilliant story that you know will be riddled with unexpected twists and turns It stars Aidan Quinn in one of his best performances and serves him with great support by Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley who are both in great form Something like 40 out of 42 user comments like this movie most of them cant seem to praise it enough So what are you waiting for If you call yourself a fan of actionthrillers you should have bought it rented it seen it YESTERDAY

0,Its rare that I come across a film this awful this annoying and this irritating It is without doubt one of the worst films Ive ever seen The plot when its not a blur of confusing and pointlessly over flashy editing is ludicrous Why did Domino become such a badass tough bitch Because her gold fish died when she was a kid and this traumatic event left her emotionally stunted and hating everyone When the dialogue is not clichÃ©d or banal its littered with laughable lines such as There are three kinds of people in this world the rich the poor and everyone else At one point the bounty hunters have some guy tied up in the back of their bus who has a combination number tattooed on his arm Because of a confusing mobile phone call instead of rolling his sleeve up and just reading the number they blow off his arm with a shotgun At another point the bounty hunters take a bomb to a meeting arranged with the mafia and threaten to set the bomb off unless the mafia let them go Clearly not going to the meeting would have been just too easy Keira Knightley is unconvincing and dreadfully miscast Mickey Rourke does manage to salvage some credibility from this mess I have enjoyed some of Tony Scotts previous films True Romance being one but all I could think while suffering this drivel was that it must have been made by a complete idiot
1,The plot line is an expose of the under belly of American politics While the theme seems common what makes the movie is the unconventional way the story is told The characters are played with conviction You feel the innocence of the lead and his innocence lost The politician is the prince of doubletalk a real snake The camera work is impressive It affirms the nuances of the acting and dialogue Ditto for the music The story uses a parablestyle with vingettes where the message is filled with doubleentendres A very canny strategy by the writerdirector The tension in the storyline is carried through to the last scenes The movie was like a good mystery book Something was afoot you knew it was bad you didnt know exactly what it could be  you had your suspicions and when the evil was revealed you let out your breath you hadnt noticed you were holding in Saddened shaking your head A story well written and well told 3 cheers to a young writerdirector
1, First of all I reviewed this documentary because I had an interest in the subject it portrayed the LA punks I listened that music and I loved that music and I read a lot of the small zines that were made in the early 80s and that were not so easily achieved in Finland So if you dont like this kind of music why you write here about it I like this kind of music it speaks my soul thus I know punks from all over Europe  Americas so why do you who find this music repugnant care to comment at all 
0,Considering John Doe apparently inspired Kyle XYs creator I was expecting its pilot to be quite interesting However I probably had too high expectations because I was quite disappointed by it First they turned the protagonist into a freak who had the crazy idea of showing off his amazing knowledge in front of an audience in a public area So after that scene I began to worry that it was just entertainment But the problem is that it got worse as none of the other characters were properly introduced They focused too much on John Doe which made the story far less intriguing I was also slightly disappointed by Dominic Purcells performance because I found he didnt make a believable John Doe An other problem was the police story It really felt like dÃ©jÃ  vu and it wasnt a pleasant sensation It leads us to the worst issue in the bunch the episodic format I could already see the fillers coming one after an other So overall I was very disappointed by it and dont recommend it to anyone Considering how bad it was I better understand now why the show got canceled In some way I have the impression that it missed its target developing characters to help the protagonist find his own identity Its sad because there was potential like the people he met at the club The production quality was also quite good and the casting correct But Ill never know if it got better probably not because I dont plan to watch the next episode
0,May Contain Spoilers A luckless South Sea islander is executed by other Caucasianlooking natives after he befriends visiting scientists Tod Andrews and Tina Carver The meddlesome scientists dig him up and find that he has taken the form of a humanoid tree He comes to life and goes on a rampage and sure enough that Fifties boogeyman the ABomb is blamed for this aberration To state that this particular monster walks like it has a stick up its a would be redundant Suffice it to say that the critter lumbers along like the film itself throwing his enemies into some handy quicksand and giving the main characters one more thing to make stupid comments about Paul Blaisdell created the treeman suit and its hardly his best work Over the years this flick has been sujected to many comments like To Hell it can go Personally I think its the best walkingtree movie Ive ever seen
1,Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Fords work Mainly because its the only one that is based on a story written by John Ford himself the story that was elaborated by Frank Nugent and directors son Â– Patrick Ford and turned into a screenplay and because of directors personal opinion regarding it Wagon Master is the film John Ford called the one which came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve to say so is not to say a little but as Ford confessed once to Lindsay Anderson his favourite was nonetheless My Darling Clementine and not any other  Wagon Master has all ingredients one might expect to find in a John Fords film Wonderful cast delivering his best thou not featuring any major stars except the most fordian of all actors Â– Ben Johnson Very peculiar small characters who provide an obligatory comic relief and Wagon Master has quite a few of them such as horn blowing Sister Ledyard Jane Darwell in her shot but very inspired gigs And last but not least legendary Monument Valley with John Fords fifth passage through it after Stagecoach My Darling Clementine Fort Apache and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon  The film starts with two friends cowboys Travis Blue Ben Johnson and Sandy Owens Harry Carey Jr being hired to be Wagon Masters or guides for a caravan of Mormon settlers who are headed to Silver Valley a place thats for them like a promised land On their way they are joined by a very peculiar Dr Locksley Hall Alan Mowbray with two beautiful women who are supposedly his wife and daughter and who call themselves actors They are headed in the same direction simply because they were recently driven out of the nearest town and have no other place to go Nothing particularly unpleasant happens till they bump into Cleggs a dangerous family gang consisting of father and his three sons who are on the run from the Marshal of the town where they recently committed murder and bank robbery  Overall Wagon Master is no more nor less than one more precious pearl in a necklace of John Fords wonderful Westerns A must see 910 
1,There have been many excellent comments about this movie and I want to add my voice to the praise Yul Brynner has never been more powerfully attractive His Major Surov was riveting Your eyes just cannot leave the screen when hes on it This is his movie This is not to slight the rest of the cast which was also exemplary especially Deborah Kerr and Anne Jackson As they were mostly stage actors they brought many nuances to their performances For example I have seen this movie at least 4 times but this is the first time I noticed the reaction of the German girl when she came facetoface with a Russian soldier Even though he was not threatening her absolutely hysterical reaction made me realize that she must have been in Germany after WWII and was most likely gangraped by the Red Army The possibility of discovering deeper layers of story that may lie just beneath the surface makes me want to see this fascinating film again and again Please put it on DVD
0,With nothing better to do I decided to check out Aztec Rex as it was being billed for the hell of it The silly story might have played better if the dinosaur effects were convincing They actually looked like animatics those rough designs that artists later use to finish the CGI effects adding more details smoother movements etc Absolutely awfullooking dinosaurs which is the only reason youd probably want to sit through this anyway The one redeeming factor was the lovely Dichen Lachman as Ayacoatl She kept my interest if only the budget had been ramped up and some convincing dinosaurs could have been used Disappointing At least the cast and crew got a free trip to Hawaii where the movie was filmed
0,I normally only write reviews for movies I really hated or really liked And as you can probably tell from the number of stars up there I didnt like it By now I assume you have read about the plot or maybe even seen the movie so Ill skip the summary Lets break this down pros and cons Cons The concept The premise was set up to be interesting Using Chaos theory as a theme was interesting However it wasnt carried out so well Correct me if Im wrong but it seems to me that Chaos theory was kind of misrepresented The event that occurred in the movie seemed more like contrived coincidence than anything I guess the Butterfly effect was represented by the whole Gods causes Tsunami to bring back statue The presentation comes off as really sloppy though Some people call this intelligent but it just seems to be another souped up action film Storyline Is it just me or does it seem that Kamal just threw this together to give him an excuse to play ten roles The plot is extremely contrived Govind kept losing the vial so many times in obscure accidents his friend just happens to mix up the vial with a package he was sending to India a crazy old lady just happens to throw the vial into an idol half the cast just happens to unexpectedly meet up in the same hospital and the case with the idol just happened to get mixed up with one that belonged to a famous singer CGI Oh god the CGI It was even worse than the special effects in Jaws 3 and those sucked Right away I could tell which parts were animated Even my tenyearold cousin knows that underwater cars dont look like that  Stunts Yes I now that action scenes in Tamil movies arent realistic but the stunts in this one were horrid and actually distracted me from the story Make up I have to admit they did a better job than expected I thought Kamal would be playing people with similar skin tones so the two fake white guys and the fake Japanese Aikido guy caught me off guard However it was still pretty bad I could easily tell which ones were wearing masks The songs The music was distracting and outofplace in many instances Asin Her character was possibly the most annoying one in the movie She was loud ditsy and obsessed irrationally about that idol I actually found myself wishing she would die Plot holes and Fridge Logic Let me get this straight a lab monkey was smart enough to get past a passwordlocked door but not intelligent enough to tell the difference between a bar of chocolate and a vial with a deadly virus in it And then an exCIA agent whos after the vial figures out its headed for India Instead of immediately following it he marries a pole dancer first A famous Punjabi singer with cancer checks into a small town hospital in the third world when he could easily afford the best medical treatment available Furthermore he gets shot in the throat with a bullet Youd think he would be killed but instead the magic bullet has cleared his tumor You read that right a BULLET knocked out the tumor  Pros The Naidu Character Possibly the only likable part of the movie was his comedy
1,I bought the DVD a long time ago and finally got around to watching itI really enjoyed watching this film as you dont get the chance to see many of the more serious better quality bollywood films like this Very well done and but I would say you need to pay attention to what is going on as it is easy to get lost When you start watching the movie dont do anything else I would actually advise people to read all the reviews hereincluding the ones with spoilers before watching the movie Raima Sen gave her first great performance that I have seen Aishwarya was easily at her best All performances were strong directing and cinematographygo watch it
1,These guys combine lowbrow with lowbudget Its glorious Look if you want Bergman rent 7th Seal or something If you want to see grossout humor and exploitation sex this is the one I think Jane Jensen as Julia makes it all watchable She can actually act really well shes a complete dreamboat and she doesnt seem to feel above it all
0,Alan Rudolph is a soso director without that special touch As an example there was one shot in The Secret Lives of Dentists in the dental office which could have expressed the entire relationship between the husband and wife Rudolph squandered it The camera is in the hallway looking through the doorways of the two dental offices with Dana and Dave each alone in their respective rooms You get the idea of their desolation and isolation but not much more The lighting the colors the body language the facial expressions could all have been vastly improved upon If I were directing I would have spent all day if necessary to get that shot right Thats the beauty and power of film it can express so much whole lives in a matter of seconds The shot with the toddler stepping in the puddle of puke could have been improved on The child should have shown more fascination with the puddle should have stomped and shuffled her feet should have had her head bent down to look at the puddle with all her attention  Campbell didnt deliver He plays a uncommunicative man true but instead of conveying his inner turmoil in voice gesture body movement the film relies on voiceover narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho alterego played by Denis Leary
1,I would almost give it 10 out of 10 However there are some confusing parts as well as sections that are missleading which hurt the flowcontinuity of the film The story line is great and well composed you will definitely want to watch this quietly to fully understand it The characters are complicated and so is the story line expect to be given only enough information to stop scratching your head its a film where all is explained in the end The animation is great and the combination of femme fatal and film noir result in a great film that is unlike anything else Ive seen in animation It is a black and white film and its quiet dark in a few scenes so its worth watching it on a good TV or plasma The character voices do save this film in its English version but it would have been more convincing if there were some French accents to emphasize that its happening Paris I enjoyed it more in French with English subtitles One the whole its well worth buying on DVD or BlueRay if they have it And personally if you enjoyed this film you might also like Waking Life  Ghost in a Shell 2 Innocence this is just a personal suggestion
1, my favorite science fiction incredible ride through mistrust and the warping of reality Probably the best performance I have ever seen Jude Law play Incredibly original with interesting character developments and a story line that twists and turns so rapidly that it takes a couple of minutes after the film to fully grasps its genius Even more fun watching it again for the end changes the beginning
0,This film probably would have been goodif they didnt use CGI computer generated imageryfor the werewolf scenesIt made the creatures look fake and the werewolves looked cartoonishCGI is great for certain effects like the dinasours in Jurassic Park or TwisterBut when we see a film where the creature must look completely realCGI is not the way to goLook at An American Werewolf in LondonNo CGIJust makeup and a mechanical creature and what you come up with was more realistic than what was shown in the sequelThis film did offer a few gags that was fun to watch and the humor in this movie seemed to have drawn me in but its nothing more than a film that I thought was OKAnd thats not good enoughIn my opinionAn American Werewolf in Paris doesnt hold up to the original
1,This was the film that first indicated to me what a great actor Martin Sheen really is He modestly claims that Charlie is a better actor Charlie cant hold a candle to him I found it suspenseful and thoroughly enjoyed the intertwining of the love story with the main plot and I usually HATE love stories Theres a great plot twist at the end that struck me as being fully credible particularly in the early 80s time period and probably now also The final scene had me on the edge of my seat This film roundly illustrates that treachery is often doled out by those we trust while declared enemies have more in common than they suspect and finally that human compassion can be found where we least expect it irenerose
0,Tacky but mildly entertaining early 90s soft core comedy features Xena Sarah Bellemo Luna Tamara Landry and Sola Nicole Posey as three outerspace teenagers Xenas parents have gone on vacation for a couple of days Following some persistent persuasion from her friends Xena agrees to take her fathers spaceship for a ride The end result They wind up running out of gas in space and crashland on planet Beta 45 AKA earth Meanwhile teenagers Dave Michael Todd Davis and Jerry Ken Steadman have come to California to stay the summer with Daves Uncle Bud Joe Estevez  a beach bum who lives right on the beach The three of them wind up meeting our three space girls who have walked away from the crash without a scratch Uncle Bud is about to be thrown out from his soontobecondemned beach pad thanks to Sally Linnea Quigley who lives right up the hill and used to be in a relationship with Bud Shes also a bikini magnate and is trying to win a bikini design contest to the tune of 30000exactly what Bud would need to fix up his property so the girls decide to try to win the prize for him And thats about it folksÂ Knowing that their paper thin plot was barely enough to sustain a feature length movie the filmmakers subject us to scene after scene of endless beach parties featuring tons of extras gyrating their half naked bodies in the scorching sun Oh and lets not forget the sex Theres quite a deal of it Before I go any further I need to put this movie in context It was released in 1993 long before the advent of such soft core labels such as Surrender Cinema and Seduction Cinema Compared to these newer edgier more explicit movies the soft core movies of the 90s sure seem somewhat mild When Beach Babes From Beyond first came out in 1993 from the Full Moon offshoot Torchlight Entertainment it was heralded as the debut release of a label that specialized in mature audiences type filmsÂ Needless to say the times have changed This particular film genre has gone from a few steamy but brief sex scenes and fleeting glimpses of female full frontal nudity to extended sex scenes that occasionally threaten to venture into the realm of hardcore Looking at Beach Babes From Beyond again after viewing it upon its 93 release its safe to say that if this same film were to be made today there would be a hell of a lot more emphasis on the sex scenes and less time spent on plot and dialog As for the sex scenes themselves they tend to run hotandcoldÂ Our three space girls waste no time in getting comfortable with the boys that evening So each couple gets a soft core scene complete with annoying slow motion camera work and too dark lighting Theyre really not that horrible and are surprisingly graphic in a few spots especially the scene between Xena and Jerry that takes place in the back of a trailer But the one sex scene that REALLY leaves a lasting impression and causes you to be surprised in its overall intensity occurs quite early on in the film Sally is attending a topless photo shot with three of her models posing by a pool All of the actresses in this scene are beautiful gorgeous but Nikki Fritz stands out from all the two due to her enormous presence Remember that this point in her career she had yet to achieve the type of enormous popularity that soon would follow Her posing nude by a pool leads to an unforgettable fantasy sequence where she shows her soapy body in a tub and then again when walking away from her bath Walking toward the bed towards a nearly nude pumped up guy in the waiting we get a full length complete nude scene with her almost heart shaped rear end and perfectly shaped back Its good that Nikkis back is so muscular as it is about to get a pretty good workout Nikki spends the next few minutes completely nude with a hunky guy in a variety of positions in a scene that is filmed completely differently than the three other lovemaking scenes No dark lighting or annoying slow motion herejust two actors in one enormous bed sans sheets and covers who seem at time to be barely acting at all Nikkis ecstatic body language just goes to prove that few other actresses seem to enjoy filming sex scenes as much as she does Its really the only time where Beach Babes From Beyond truly delivers the goods But even without this spectacular scene I am mildly recommending this film just for the fact alone that its fairly watchable and never dull no thanks to an incredibly energetic and attractive cast many of whom would show up in various direct to video features in the remainder of the decade
0,Its complete nonsense Ive studied Nazism and read many manuscripts from the day  the parallels use most of the classic debased apocryphal myths of Nazism and then compare it with complete specious generalizations about what constitute 13 of the planet Its crafted for an audience of PollyAnna complacency who diet heavily on spoonfed gibberish horribly thought out arguments irrational conclusions fallacious ideas and nonsensical logic Who made this hit peace Easy When all is said and done Que Bono That is who benefits in the long run You dont You sacrifice money and rights Muslims dont they get our bombs Try again Answer this and youve unlocked a major door
1,Greystoke The Legend of Tarzan Lord of the Apes is based on the classic book Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs and is a more faithful adaptation to the classic book the film has some great scenery like the Jungles of South Africa to the Greystoke mansion the acting is also great Chirstopher Lambert did a great performance as Tarzan it was also his first English speaking role The film has some funny moments sad moments and touching moments that makes this a real classic The film sees a boat crashing in the Jungles of South Africa and some time later they have a son named John the Apes go into the hut and one of them kills the Father The Apes then take him to where they live and adopt him as one of their own as the years go by John grows up and learns to be more like the Apes In his teens his Foster Mom gets attacked by Native Hunters and soon killed by them years later a group of people are going to Africa on a expedition After setting up camp theyre soon attacked by the Natives most escape but Capitaine Phillippe DArnot is left behind injured by some of the arrows After hiding he meets John now an adult who takes him to his home and takes care of his wounds after a while Phillippe starts to teach John how to speak English and teach him that hes not one of the Apes but a person When Phillippe goes to leave John goes with him after sometime they arrive at Greystoke manor where the Sixth Earl of Greystoke is shown his long lost Grandson John is shown his bedroom and picture of his true Mom and Dad John also meets Jane Porter and slowly as they get to know each other he begins to have feelings for her when its Christmas the Sixth Earl of Greystoke slides down the stairs killing himself John then starts to miss the Jungle and wants to return but Phillipe tells him to stay since everything they had done would be for nothing John is then torn between his life as a Greystoke and the Lord of the Apes Greystoke The Legend of Tarzan Lord of the Apes is a great classic that should be seen 1010
0,My ratings Acting  310 Suspense  210 Character Attachment  110 Plot  210 Character Development  210 Overall  210 This show sucks very much officially For me CSI Miami is the best CSI NY 2nd and CSI 100th I dont know in the other CSIs you get into the episode youre watching But in this one you just cant get into the episode no matter how much you try so in my opinion this show is not worth watching I know people have different opinions and I respect that but for me this CSI aint good enough So if you like suspense real actingperformance good plot direction character developmentattachment and you an overall good show I suggest you to watch CSI Miami
0,I saw this film as a sneak preview before the Venice opening at the Telluride Film Festival Your reaction to it will largely depend on your attitude about respecting the text of Shakespeare On the plus side Pacino gives a very good performance indeed as Shylock Lynn Collins is a fine Portia and the film has a sumptuous look  The negatives are predictable The Merchant of Venice is arguably the most difficult of all of Shakespeares plays to stage today largely because we look at it through the distorting lens of 20th century history The romantic plot with Bassanio and Portia presents no problem The character of Shylock does because we lack the original frame of reference of the Elizabethan audience Shylock is simultaneously a human character with human qualities and motivations and an abstraction of the pitiless quality of the Old Law When he says Hath not a Jew eyes he is a character when he proclaims I will have my bond he is an abstraction The long passage on music and cosmic harmony in the final scene here moved and cut to ribbons is the key to the play in that it reestablishes universal harmony after the disruptive and evil the Shylock of the trial scene forces are ejected It is possible to make psychological sense of the character of Shylock by showing his gradually going mad and turning into a monomaniac by the time the trial scene rolls aroundthe key is that at a point he must cease being sympathetic Pacinos performance almost does it but not quite The film cant quite make up its mindon the one hand there is the right movement in the character of Shylock and on the other there is a great deal of extraneous footage of Jews being abused and Venetian whores with rouged nipples no doubt to show the decadence of Antonio et al Shakespeare was not writing an Ibsenlike social drama he was writing a comedy following the classic pattern of disruption of social order and the restoration of social order symbolized by marriage with a theme of love versus law at the center of the Shylock plot In this sense the film is a travestyRadfords surgery on the play and direction almost force us away from what the play really means Taking the beginning of the final scene cutting most of it and moving it before the trial scene is the most extreme example There are some other significant difficulties Jeremy Irons a fine actor plays Antonio as if he were overdosed on sedatives Joseph Fiennes is pretty but shallow as Bassanio Most of the actors with the exceptions of Collins Pacino and the actor playing the Duke in the trial scene mumble their dialogue Final verdict A pretty film with a few decent performances Its not Shakespeare its poor interpretation Not really worth your time or moneyalthough Lynn Collins as Portia almost redeems it
0,This may be the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical ever Even the music has been destroyed Attenborough knows nothing about theater  almost every shot and moment ring false I will say though that it is almost bad enough to be funny The hairstyles are remarkably dated I can not for the life of me understand what is meant conceptually by opening the film with an exterior of the theater where A Chorus Line is playing Are we to think that these people are auditioning for A Chorus Line which contains the stories about the people who are auditioning Oh no the show is collapsing on itself I saw the original production and have listened to the album hundreds of times Why oh why did they do this
1,Good luck finding this film to even watch  its not yet released on tape or DVD I saw on release in the early 70s was lucky enough to catch it via American Cinematheques preservation efforts and it still has some tangible moments that stayed with me for thirty years No reason to repeat rwints accurate comments here As a comeout Director soon after the soaring success of Five Easy Pieces Jack N has been said to have managed the low budget effort as best as possible and it certainly shows in the wandering and meandering that could have used some recutting But its also a memorable icon for its time the all very intense clashes of late 60s college sports student movements sexual revolution and more  Why see this film It was probably a ground breaker in some scenes the frisky male bonding in the aftergame showers Karen Blacks scene with Tepper in the car will catch you a little off guard  but its the first use of a word I hadnt witnessed in film before and the casual and unexpected use of nudity overall There are probably others Im omitting Look for a nice surprise of a young Cindy Williams in one of her first films a thin David Ogend Stiers Mike Warren fresh out of his powderblue UCLA uniform and readying for a darkblue TV uniform Robert Towne  Actor and a whole lot of folks simply playing themselves Now any connection between Harry Gittes last name Robert Towne and a certain character in Chinatown and the Two Jakes It gets a 7 based on Karen Black Youll see why
0,The Adventures of Hercules has to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie Ive yet run across You would have to look far and wide to find anything that approaches the level of ineptness on display in this movie Acting Â– Bad Editing Â– Bad Direction Â– Bad Special Effects Â– Bad and Laughable Plot Â– Bad Lighting Â– Bad Cinematography Â– Bad Costume Design Â– Bad and Silly Everything Else Â– Bad Watching The Adventures of Hercules is about as enjoyable as a root canal Even for a fan of bad movies its a real endurance test This is one for either masochists or Lou Ferrigno completists if any exist Eight things I learned from watching The Adventures of Hercules  1 If you dont have the budget for real special effects rotoscope a scene from the previous movie It will look great  trust me 2 When on a quest to recover Zeus thunderbolts take time for frequent stops to oilup you body It worked for Ferrigno and his two Amazon companions 3 Any sword fight use of magic and just about all other day to day activities in ancient Greece created a sound very similar to a game of Pac Man or Asteroids 4 Some of the ancient Greek gods dressed like extras from Star Wars 5 If you need to pad your crappy movies runtime extend the title sequence by adding Star Trek style credits and throw in some overly grandiose music It also helps if youve got a previous movie to pull scenes from 6 Fight scenes move along much smoother if the bad guys attack Hercules one at a time 7 William Berger did anything for money 8 I didnt think it was possible but The Adventures of Hercules makes the first film Hercules 1983 look like an Academy Award winner
1,JeanJacques career began with his essay answer to a prize question civilization makes us evil This intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument In that sense it repeats a theme common to French films society is real identity is a construction freedom is criminal Here the idea is treated literally Both main characters find themselves and each other only when breaking rules This discovery may well hold true in France at any rate its quite romantic
1,Ya That is what I think Sure it was still a great show with John in it but I personally think that it is way better without I love having CJ and Grandpa living at the house because they are so funny together When John was still around I really didnt laugh as much as I do now It is too bad that no more are being made  I dont think because I would love to see some new material My favorite character must be Rory poor Rory is almost always left out It is always about Bridget or Carrie WHAT ABOUT RORY Honestly this is a great show and to any one who has never watched it you must go and watch it I almost guarantee you will laugh well even chuckle
0,Going by the good words of my friends I hired this movie hoping that it would at least equal the laughs of the similar movie House Party but I was very disappointed and very bored Falling asleep while watching a movie is never a good sign I dont know whether this didnt appeal to me because I dont live in da hood or if Im not black but its probably one of the two It tries to spoof a few movies only coming up with a couple of laughs but in the long run it fails miserably Miss it
1,A touching love story reminiscent of Â‘In the Mood for Love Drawing heavily on Chinese poetry and how this is used by eastern people to communicate feelings to each other the story focuses on a schoolteacher who wants so much to be a model teacher as well as a good husband and father A senior student is very attracted to him As the story unfolds we see the emotions below the surface in his 20 year marriage and how he grapples with the moral dilemmas that face him A beautiful and moving story
0,Ive read all the comments on this film I am a great admirer of the Dalai Lama As such I read the book upon which this film was based The movie is an ugly and demeaning fictionalization of the truth I do not criticize it for altering small details or events for dramatic purposes it is not a documentary But the script CHANGES the impact reaction realities and changes in EVERY main character It vastly alters the real relationship between Harrar and the young Dalai Lama  From the ridiculous rivalry for a Tibetan woman which demeans the culture of Tibet to Harras music box gift to Harrars change of heart everything about this movie is false  except for the amazing photography I understand that the shots of the Potala the palace were smuggled out of Tibet However changing a real story about the relationship between two people one of them very important to this world in order to build up a movie star is sad
0,I really have no idea how to comment on this movie The special effects were lackluster the acting was terrible and if there was a plot to it all it was on the back of the box I dont think I can remember a movie being THIS bad in a long time and Im a big fan of lesbian sex and boobies  Even that couldnt save this movie from being just a terrible excuse to pay someone to stand or lay in this case in front of a camera I was pretty much let down by the overall zombie effect Since apparently in this movie zombies are so commonplace that running over a couple here and there and casually talking about it at a gas station one with an inhouse windshield repair but no interior bathroom the zombiemovie genre isnt even a factor until the end Even then a cameo by a dozen zombies ripping off a girls clothes doesnt really constitute being a zombie movie On to the vampires Apparently all the zombies are male and all the vampires are female which is OK by me Im not sure how vampires are out in the daylight or the whyhow of a soldier vampire came to be standing in the middle of the road still holding his gun with a stake through his heart just waiting for the Queen of the Vampires to flick it all the way through The last segment in the old nunnery made no sense and when one hot lesbian vampire asks the other hot lesbian vampire Do you think we did the right thing by killing the two apparent heroes in the movie that about put it over the top The acting and special effects were at an alltime low also You could almost see the hoses that the fake blood was pumped out of during the closeup of the zombie who got ran over by the General Speaking of the General where did they find THIS Kenny Rogers lookalike anyways No idea what he was the General of aside of generally confusing and misplaced All in all watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have the strong urge to waste 3 Just my 002
0,This movie had the biggest advertising campaign any movie ever had in Russia Epic movie about Russian culture Great saga of Russian spirit endless articles and interviews For me this movie was the biggest disappointment The main character played by Oleg Menshikov is a stupid immature boy ready to set up his comrades because of a woman who doesnt even look like a lady What is there to admire In the first part of the movie the story doesnt develop at all Peoples festival scenes look like boasting about Russian audacity I respect Mr Mikhalkov for his previous works both as actor and director but this movie just demonstrates his ambitions to be considered the Tzar of Russian cinema
1,A classy film pulled in 2 directions To its advantage it is directed by Wes Craven On the downside the TV film budget shows what could have been so much more with a larger budget It moves along as Susan Lucci draws Robert Urichfamily into her clutches and trying to persuade him into the secret of her health club His latest invention a spacesuit which can analyse people or things becomes unexpectedly useful in his new neighbourhood Anyone seeing this should pay attention to Susan Lucci Her looks and performance had an unexpected repercussions a few years later The actor scientist and parapsychologist Stephen Armourae is a fan of this film and wrote a review of this film Lucci became subject of a portrait by him followed as the basis for works of a sitter called Catherine Lucci and Barbara Steeles portrait in Black Sunday were used as references for the Catherine portraits which were immediately withdrawn by Armourae Probably due to a personal nature between the artist and Catherine So by seeing both films we can get an insight into another story and the appearance of unknown woman that would make an interesting film
1,SPOILERS 911 is a very good and VERY realistic documentary about the attacks on the WTC2 French film makers who are in New York to film the actions of a NYFD are being confronted with this event and make the most of itBefore 911 nothing much really happens which gives the movie an even more horror like scenario On the day of the attacks it seems like just another dull day at work but this will soon changeAs one the film makers goes on the road with the firemen he films the first crashing planethis is the only footage of the first impactHe rides with the firemen to the WTC and goes inside the buildingAs the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accidentIn the next period of time we see firemen making plans to save as many people as possiblein the meanwhile we hear banging soundsthese are the sounds of people who jumped down from the tower and falling on the groundthis is the most grueling moment in the documentaryThen the tower collapses and our French friend has to run for his lifeyou hear him breath like a madman while he runs out of the buildingThen a huge sort of sandstorm blasts over him and the screen turns blackhe was very lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of Downtown New York Because this documentary has got so much historical footage and because the film was ment to be something totally different this documentary will probably stay in everybodys memoryI saw the attacks live at home because I had the afternoon ofso this makes it even more realistic to watch 1010
0,This Drummond entry is lacking in continuity Most of them have their elements of silliness the postponed wedding and so on However this has an endless series of events occurring in near darkness as the characters run from one place to another The house seems more like a city Theres also Leo G Carrol who is such an obvious suspect who noone seems to even look at He is a stranger and acts rather suspicious but Drummond and the folks dont seem to pick up on anything Still it as reasonably good action and a pretty good ending I know that Algie is supposed to be a comic figure but like Nigel Bruce in the Rathbone Sherlock Holmes flicks he is so buffoonish that its hard to imagine anyone with taste or intelligence being around him Is there a history behind him that will explain how he and Drummond became associates

1,I had never seen such an incredible acting job in a motion picture as I did when I saw Daniel DayLewis play Christy Brown in My Left Foot In fact off the scene his role wasnt even over He played the role of Christy Brown or at least disabled like him all through the filming of the movie and needed surgery because of the damage his superior acting had done to his back To me that is remarkable and through all the pain he put up with to act that role I believe it is quite true to say he put on the most Oscar worthy performance in history He was so masterful in this tough a part that I believe no one could have done it better or with more of an impact than him Although I cannot say it is the greatest movie of all time I can say that how he played this impossible a role and then kept on acting it until it wasnt even acting anymore is without a doubt the greatest feet I will ever seen an actor do Probably a man too for that matter
0,I have never seen the first Killjoy film and I have also never heard a good thing said about it So I see Killjoy 2 in the local Blockbusters and pick it up and look at the back Starring Trent Haaga and Debbie Rochon it boasts Now being the massive Troma fan that I am there is no way Im not going to rent this film out how can it possibly be bad with these two in it Oh how wrong I was Even Trent and Debbie cant save this excuse of a film from being as bad as it truly is Trent quite frankly stinks as Killjoy although this probably is more the fault of the writers giving him some of the worst oneliners in the history of film Debbie does put a solid performance in but it isnt enough The kills are terrible as are the gore effects For example check out when the guy is supposedly impaled on something or other And just to top it all off the ending is just amongst the worst I have ever seen in movie history The film doesnt even work on a so bad its good level Avoid like the clap 210
0,I do get irritated with modern adaptations of Shakespeare when the director cant make his mind up whether to use the original or to update it If its using the original words in an updated setting thats particularly tricky if set in the 20th or 21st century although it can work OK in period styles eg the Trevor Nunn Twelfth Night set late Victorian very effectively It could work with the 30s setting if only there had been far less of the song and dance and far more of Shakespeares text Unfortunately it just ends up being a pretty trivial though very pleasant show  Another problem is Branagh himself I agree hes far too old to play one of the students but more important hes such an experienced Shakespearean actor that in spite of all his efforts to be just another student his strength of acting shows all the time Of course he should have played the King  no problem in having a mature student King surrounded by younger students Instead we had a pleasant but unimposing actor for the King thus an unimposing socalled King with no Kingly attributes  The amount of song and dance which I found tedious in spite of the nice songs and pleasant enough dancing unfortunately meant the great Shakespearean dialogue had to be cut down drastically So the whole thing ends up a trivial and mild confection and I got very bored including with the comic turns and was glad when it ended Branagh has not done Shakespeare justice in this production Accolades however to Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan absolutely splendid as the older couple
1,Dead Man Walking is a film not about the death penalty but about the people involved in a death penalty case  the killer the families whose kids were killed the nun who becomes his spiritual advisor and what happens It tells the story with little fanfare but a lot of compassion and sensitivity I have it on DVD and every time I watch it not often its never an easy film to watch Im more impressed by what Tim Robbins and the entire cast did here So revealing that it could be a documentary so compelling you cant take your eyes away so subtle and yet so powerful Dead Man Walking is nothing short of a masterpiece It doesnt matter whether youre for or against the death penalty or even have no opinion this movie will have you thinking about the issues for sure It takes a courageous screenwriter and director to look this material in the face without flinching even once and everyone involved in the film pulls it off  there isnt a single scene that rings false A masterful film but dont expect light viewing to some the final scenes could be more graphic than anything imaginable even though no blood or violence is shown You get drawn into this film and become a participant and theres a character for just about everyone to identify with 1010
1,This is a surprisingly great low budget HorrorComedy its funny and pretty well made with good performances and a really cool twist ending All the characters are pretty cool and the story while unoriginal is very good plus Eric JungmannAdam and Justin UrichHarley had fantastic chemistry together One of the funniest moments in the film for me is when Adam is trapped in the bathroom and Harley wakes up to find that monster truck sitting there and decides to take a pss in the truck and Aimee Brooks is just plain sexy plus this is one of the best low budget Horror films I have seen in a long time Its very gory but in a comical way and I thought it was very well written as well plus Michael Bailey Smith is fantastic as the Monster Man and had some wicked makeup Its similar to films like Joy Ride Duel Jeepers Creepers etc etc and it has some suspenseful moments here and there plus The gore effects are really well done for the most part This is a surprisingly great low budget HorrorComedy its funny and pretty well made with good performances and a really cool twist ending I highly recommend this one The Direction is very good Michael Davis does a very good job here with great camera work good anglesgood use of colors and using a great setting plus he kept the film funny and at a very fast pace There is a lot of gore We get extremely bloody nose bleedsgory impalings bloody stabbingsguy is cut in half by a monster truck human remains in a cooked stew guts all over the placeguys guts fall outpencil in the eyesbloody slit throatbunch of people walking around without limbsgory dead squirrelheads are squishedsevered limbsbloody and mangled corpsesdecent amount of bloodshedone very gory scene at the very end and more The Acting is very good for a low budget film Eric Jungmann is fantastic here as Adam he was a nerd but a very likable one he had fantastic chemistry with Justin Urich had some cool linesand I just loved his character he also seemed to be enjoying himselfand he was especially good at the end Justin Urich is excellent as the ass of a Best Friend however I just couldnt help but love him as he was very funny and often stole a lot of the scenes I really dug him Aimee Brooks is gorgeous and did great with what she had to do she had good chemistry with Jungmann and like Jungmann was especially good at the end as I loved her mysterious character Michael Bailey Smith is wonderful as The Monster Man he was very creepy looking had some awesome makeup and is now one of my favorite slashers Rest of the cast do fine Overall I highly recommend this one 12 out of 5
1,Im from Romania ill try to speak in English All i want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my all time number one Seen it above 30 times at least and will see it for many years now It has all the little things i like in a movie  its very touching makes me cry  Shows a whole lot of twisted love things and questions about love and reality  and the true things that matter for different people It so happens that for me this matters the most  the love  the soul of a man  hes inner being and this i see in this movie Perhaps for me its much more than a motion picture  its a proof in my mind that it could really exist and that you most make the best out of every moment you live with your soul mate Its a long way from reality to scifi  but  what if What if all the capitalism disappeared and economy would go down  would fall We would all be concerned about other issues and my thought is that  on your death bed  the bigger thing you remember  is not the wealth  not the adventure  not the countries you visited and the people that remember you But the true friends and your true love and the hope that after you die  all will be god damn perfect and people would be good and care more WATCH THIS MOVIE and probably it will guide you through your life like it did to me  Hail from Romania
0,The movie starts in spring 2001 A soldier named John Tyree Channing Tatum falls in love with college student Savannah Cutis Amanda Seyfried while on break Within the space of two weeks they fall madly in love with each other  But he has to go off to war and she has to go to college They do but keep in touch by writing to each other Then 911 happens He wants to reenlistshe wants him to stay home What will they do  Hysterically bad romantic drama The leads ARE attractiveTatum is certainly a handsome man with beautiful green eyes and a hot body hes introduced walking shirtless out of the water after surfingbut he cant act Seyfried is a beautiful woman and she triesbut the dialogue here is horrible When I saw it me and a friend of mine were fighting hard NOT to laugh out loud at some of the romantic dialogue at the beginning It was just HORRIBLE For the first hour or so I was either bored by the ridiculously predictable drama or amused by the horrendous romance Then after that first hour tragedy kicks in and I must admit had me in tears However the filmmakers go out of their way to make sure that youre crying with death funerals and meetings with people breaking down in tears How can you NOT cry This would have worked if the acting were better Tatums face never changes expressionnot ONCE He always had a blank look on his face Seyfried was a LITTLE better but not much To make it worse Tatum and Seyfried had no sexual chemistry on screen at all They barely looked like they liked each other let alone love each other There was some beautiful photography of the Carolinas but this is a boring and stupid romantic drama A 1 all the wayand I usually love silly romantic dramas like this
1,I saw this film for the very first time several years ago  and was hooked up in an instant It is great and much better than J F K cause you always have to think Can it happen to me Can I become a murderer You cannot turn of the TV or your VCR without thinking about the plot and the end which you shouldnt miss under any circumstances
0,No Just NO Thats all that needs to be said Summary A random guy is in a cornfield For some reason Im not sure but its his duty to run around inside The next great thriller A five year old could make a better movie just filming an anthill or even just grass growing Seriously You cant say it has bad acting because there is NO acting You cant say it has bad writing because it has NO writing You cant say it has bad cinematography because there is NO cinematography You cant say its a bad movie BECAUSE THERE IS NO MOVIE If you dont believe me go watch it Just dont say I never warned you
1,I first saw this movie on an Alaska Airlines flight and have since seen it twice more It simply is  and is simply  one of the best films in years I found myself having enjoyed it after my first viewing but a little cloudy on what had happened After seeing it again a few weeks later things began to fall into place It wasnt confusing just deep In fact the depth of the movie may not be appreciated for a long time For example it occurred to me only after my third viewing that Sammy Davis Jr Jr Grandfathers dog is more than just a pet  perhaps shes the standin for his dead wife Witness how fiercely he protects her There is symbolism galore and none of it sappy or indulgent just real The adventure of their trip keeps the storyline in perpetual motion and even when they arrive youre not sure if it really was the destination As the movie continues so does the adventure and I got the sense the destination was merely a waypoint The soundtrack is fun the scenery compelling  and both decidedly easternblock I could go on and on about the deeper meanings within the film but Im not entirely sure Ive discovered all the nuances yet Besides its more fun to tease these out yourself As much as any film can be Everything Is Illuminated has proved to be like a fine wine that sweetens with time I highly recommend seeing it  twice
1,I really enjoy this particular production of The Mikado The producers added a few touches throughout to make it more amusing for modern audiences  for instance As Some Day It May Happen the little list song is completely updated and a few lines are adlibbed throughout the play Liberties were also taken with the setting The costumes are not Japanese but rather 1920s English although some of the Tittipudlian girls wear 20sinspired kimonos This production is wellchoreographed with some 1920s dance styles and there are some extra dancing maids and bellhops to keep your eyes as well as ears entertained during the songs If youre a Gilbert  Sullivan purist these changes may bother you but I think theyre fine  and I love the costumes  Felicity Palmer Katisha is absolutely hilarious all of her scenes make me laugh out loud one of my favorite addons is when she first makes an entrance  the dancing bellhops annoy her with their antics so she screeches at the top of her voice STOP IT All of the other main characters do a fine job as well I particularly like Mark Richardson as PishTush that toupee and Lesley Garrett as YumYum You must keep in mind that this is a stage production being filmed and set your expectations accordingly There is no change of setting although the filmmakers used some 1930s film techniques to add interest If there is one drawback to this production it is that the stage makeup wasnt modified for closeup shots with a camera Foundation lines are often visible and there seems to be a surplus of eyeliner lipstick and blush everywhere Ive seen this sort of thing happen before with films of plays and its a little jarring at first However I hope youll get used to it and enjoy The Mikado for what its worth  a thoroughly enjoyable rendition of a classic

1,Really dont care that no one on here likes this movie i do  and thats what this review is about Lou Diamond Phillips is great in this comedic role that line about train a b and c is now to me an instant classic the cg is great yeah train looks a little fake but the aliens wow do they ever rock Todd Bridges wheres Arnold and Mr Drummond wow hes been out of the loop  guess thats what jail does to you a bullet train is on its way to Las Vegas with the Senator for him to deliver a big speech a meteor has just hit and now all of a sudden we got aliens running loose aboard the train and our hero cop has to save the day to make matters worse his exwife is on board arguing with him i just thought this movie was so wonderful a must see if you like action
1,What a gas of a movie Film Noir has always been one of my favorite genres but this one stands apart from the rest Only The Big Sleep Out of the Past Murder My Sweet and The Killers can come close to this caper classic I know these four American films I mentioned are not caper movies per se but rather detective stories with complicated story lines which still exude a noirean gritty quality about them similar to Rififi What is different here is the way Jules Dassin sets into motion the total ambiance of the film not only in the gritty realism of the principals but also in the usage of the streets of Paris as a subliminal character and coconspirator unto itself The movie centers around le Stephanois a dark moody and complicated excon getting pulled into one last shot at the hefty payoff Even though he is an unsmiling and hardnosed tough guy one still senses in him a yearning for some kind of redemption by extricating himself from the demons of his past hey he saved little Toni Dassin picked the right guy Jean Servais for that role That aside the rest of the story development kind of falls into place as we journey through the famous silent caper scene to the the eventual demise of the principal perps Only their women survive except for Ida Marios honey They seemed to best understand the underlying futility of it all
1,And I do Peter Falk has created a role that will live on forever in TV land And Im grateful for that This isnt one of his finest hours though Columbo goes to college and basically teaches how he solves a crime and yet there are bad guys who go ahead and think theyre smarter than he is What all us fans know is that Columbo needs a worthy opponent Without a great enemy how can he be the hero in the wrinkled coat Still its better than NO Columbo and Ill wait and watch the next one as well
0,Boasting some pretty good Rick Bakeresque special effects and Deran Serafian in a small role this pretty lame Italian movie deserves some recognition Cerchi gets some credit for still making gore flicks while most of the other Italian directors Ruggero Deodato Sergio Martino Lamberto Bava and Enzo G Castellari have moved on to lowerkey TV movies As for plankton its half Piranha  half The Thing with people turninging into monsters raping women and causing general mayhem The ultragrimy sleazy and oversexed feel of the film makes it hard to enjoy Only available in Italian language workprints floating around
0,This was a film based on the Novel written by the modern literary god that is Koontz I refuse to believe that studio bought the rights to this movie for anything using the Genius Koontz name Ever since my sight became poor enough to require Large Print I have been unable to read this book as I had at least twice a year since first reading it I missed the book greatly and was unable to find it in Large Print I was hoping by renting this movie I would at least get my vicarious Watchers pleasures but this movie was a travesty Because of subtle plot points it is my belief none of Mr Koontzs or most decent authors for that matter books can be crammed into 12 hours of film It will be the wise network cable or other wise who buys the rights to this novel and makes a multiple part television movie ie mini series of this book the RIGHT way one a star out of five  would that I could go lower 
0,Starting where the last AVP left off an Alien chestburster emerges from a dead Predator on a Predator spaceship and causes the Predator space ship to crash into modern day Gunnison Colorado where it breeds several more Aliens which start to cause havoc The Predator race sends down a lone highly experienced and armed Predator to clean up the mess Our human characters are caught in the middle of the intergalactic battle The biggest problem with this movie is the pacing This movie moves along way too fast The opening credits have only just rolled and already the Predator ship crashes into the Earth after the Alien grows to full hight a hunter and son character are introduced but before we even get to learn their names they are both killed then we see the Predator homeworld and the lead Predator flies off to fight the Alien infestation and all this happens within the first five minutes This unnatural pace does not let up for the entire movie the National Guard comes into town but within two minutes are all killed without even getting a good look at a single ones face the manager of a pizza store gets one scene of character development only to be killed off the very next time we see him once again without even learning his name random hobos a coffee shop waitress and chef are killed again without learning their names One moment our main characters are at home the next running around town the next in a gun store  the next in an APC and this random set jumping over and over just doesnt ever let up leaving the audience no time to settle in leaving them grasping for straws Another problem is the settings and time frame The movie is set in modern day Gunnison Colorado Every other Alien and Predator movie was shot in enthralling settings such as industrial space ships guerrilla war zone rainforests alien planets and underground labyrinths Now comes along AVPR set in a small modern day American town with set highlights including a sporting goods store parking lots Pizza Shops and little girls bedrooms I mean were they actually trying to make the movie look as dull drab and uninteresting as possible Its hard to perceive these monsters as frightening creatures when they are standing next to a shelf full of Reeboks or hiding in the bushes outside little girls bedrooms Continuity is a big issue with this film The Alien series was set in the future no human had even heard of an Alien before the first film and the Aliens not only had never been to Earth but if they ever did reach Earth humanity would be destroyed This movie ruins that entire concept by being set in modern day with Average Joes seeing the Aliens all over the place and by the end of the movie humanity is not destroyed not even suffering what could be considered minor losses It pisses all over that entire concept of the other movies Attempts to maintain continuity are made with massive Deus Ex Machinas The Predator just happens to carry around a bottle of unlimited magic blue liquid thats just to melt away any bodies with just a single drop the army at the end of the movie just happens to go to overly drastic measures and drop a nuclear warhead that just conveniently erases all evidence of the Aliens existence despite the fact there were many survivors of the incident who are witnesses and many more bad attempts are made at filling up impossible to cover plot holes Also for a Verses movie it has unrelenting bias in favor of the Predators For the majority of the film a lone Predator manages to kill dozens if not tens of dozens of Aliens all at mÃªlÃ©e range while barely gaining a single scratch while the Aliens just get slaughtered left right and center like clay pigeons merely waiting their turn to be killed by the Predator without putting forth any effort to defend their selves This movie should not be called Alien vs Predator as much as it should be Predator massacres Aliens I mean how can you have two species battle it out with suspense and tension when one is portrayed as being vastly superior to the other  The characters in this film are amongst the biggest flaws Not only do they pale in comparison to the characters from the previous Alien and Predator movies but even as a stand alone movie they are bland dreary and even at times cringe worthy The characters in this movie consist of I kid you not horny couples wanting to get laid pizza delivery boys blonde bimbos high school bullies children and a blatant copy and paste job ripping off Ripley and Newt the worst and most clichÃ© possible ideas for characters Not only that but all of the aforementioned characters are acted by teenagers While the casting of teenagers is an obvious attempt to pull in younger audiences its only effect is to make the movie look and feel like a typical teenybopper slasherporn movie with actors who are too young to have learned how to give a convincing performance with them mostly having completely blank facial expressions delivering monotone dialog Not only this but these characters do some of the most cinematically retarded things ever such as using Predator guns commenting the powers out when it has been for hours following dumb plans to get out of town rather than just walking out of town somewhat quickly and just so many other idiocies that the movie actually had the audience in my theater sighing out of frustration In the end this movie is just a horrible B movie something deserving of the direct to DVD category The fact this movie was a theatrical release astonishes me as every part of the movie just ranks of amateur work

0,He pulled the guys guts out his butt Thats a spoof right No one really writes that it just happens like improv gone horribly wrong I think any way This movie must be a spoof because who would say they wrote that script otherwise Can anyone imagine the entire cast sitting around as the director and writers go over the storyboard Director says next our inbreed villain uses his 24 inch machete to disembowel our token creepy neighbor Get this he is going to pull the guts out his bunghole Brilliant the entire cast proclaims No way can that happen nobody writes that stupid Gotta be a spoof I loved the part where the skinny introspective gal beats the inbreed freak to death with the cast iron skillet she finds on the floor of the cave I wasnt sure the inbreed cannibal types bothered to cook much Maybe that explains why the skillet was lying on the floor in the dark at just the right time to kill the malformed hulk Seems ironic that after the freaky guy had bested martial arts expert porn queens and a couple out doors type jocks he falls so easily to the frying pan of a skinny defenseless girl next door  What the heck is that Richard Greco guy doing in this Did he fire his agent or something  Can anyone explain the ending to me please because I didnt get it either I cant quite figure why the nice hero girl wanted to kill the funny lady who was making her some tea Never mind I dont want to know
0,This Life is truly as bad as it gets Its cast of mercenary lascivious ruthless duplicitous shallow characters are intended as a reflection on its posteighties setting and I have to admit in this regard it is an accurate creation Unfortunately it leaves me nothing to sympathise with or care about and I regard it as just another step toward the television premiumrate phone in scams astonishingly bad cheap reality and celebrity saturated television and other cut and run attitudes that have destroyed this medium and indeed much of British society Sounds exaggerated I dont think it is In this regard programs such as This Life have indeed been as influential as they are often called
1,There is nothing not to like about Moonstruck Im from a New York Italian family and I actually get a little homesick when I watch it The actors  actresses the plot the subplots the humor they were all fantastic It starts a little slow but a lot happens in that two days I fell in love with LaBoheme because of this movie On my list of favorite movies Moonstruck is number 3 Its a feel good movie where you leave the theatre humming thats amore or repeating some of your favorite lines old man if you give those dogs another piece of my food Ill kick you till youre dead Chrissy bring me the big knife whos dead do you love him Loretta good because when you do they drive you crazy because they know they can I always put Moonstruck on when theres nothing good to watch because it makes me happy
1,A Three Stooges short this one featuring Shemp Of all those involving Shemp Ive seen this is my favorite performance by him in a Stooges short The basic plot is that Shemp must get married by 6 oclock that very evening if hes to inherit the half a million dollars a rich uncle left him in his will So Shemp sets out to get himself a bride but finds it a tougher road than expected that is until they learn of his inheritance money Best bits here involve Shemp shaving Shemp and Moe in a telephone booth and Larry on piano as accompaniment to Shemps voicetraining session Also the sequence where Shemp is mistaken as Cousin Basil and its outcome proves hilarious
1,Imagine being so hampered by a bureaucracy that a one man spends 8 years of his life and has a mental breakdown trying to solve a mass murder case virtually by himself The murder technique is clear but a government unwilling to admit the truth lets a monster destroy dozens of lives When I think my job is stressful I merely remember the true story behind this wonder flick The devotion to duty of the main character was masterfully portrayed by Rea The comic and almost tragic at times relationship between Rea and the Sutherland character made this one of my favorite movies of the last 5 years The catching of one of the worst mass murderers in history had me on the edge of my seat While not nearly as well advertised and talked about as Silence of the Lambs the plot was just as suspenseful Rent or buy this movie today
0,The only thing in Sudden Death that outdoes the amount of nonstop action is the incredible number of plot holes What with that and the sheer amount of contrivances one could hardly call whats left a storyline To say the screenplay has borrowed from the Die Hard premise would be to make the worlds most blatant understatement Here we have a troubled hero working in the huge Pittsburgh Indoor Ice Rink as a fire Marshall On the night of the seventh game of the finals series he gets tickets so he can treat his estranged children to the deciding game and of course spend a little time with them Also catching the match but for political reasons is the Vice President of the United States Raymond J Barry When a bunch of incredibly well organised mercenaries capture the VPs box and demand hundreds of millions in government money our hero Darren McCord has his plans more than slightly put out Each time a new one of these formula flicks is made it seems that all we get in the way of innovation is nastier bad guys and more and more spectacular and gruesome ways in which the good guys dispose of them Director Hyams and his screenwriter have gone over the top not that this is an original sin in trying to make us loathe the wicked terrorists The horrible baddies go about shooting the secret service the security and the civilians both old and young with gay abandon and with scant regard for the relative threat of each victim Van Damme engages in plenty of fistycuffs and gunplay heroics and death defying stunts The script asks little of the musclebound European Almost everyone else has walkons apart from Powers Boothe who seriously overdoes his under written shallow role as the cruelest meanest old ring leader there ever was Theres a lot of clever cinematography and enough explosive special fx to keep anyone awake But really thats all this action flick has action Though there are some nifty sequences nothing could be called outrageously brilliant Saturday February 10 1996  Greater Union Melbourne
0,This is definitely a stupid badtaste movie Eddie Murphy stars in what is written like a sitcom He is surrounded with his perfect family full of good family values If youre looking for politically correct entertainment this movie is for you But if you hate the idea of being the only one not to laugh at obscene gags in a movietheater full of popcorn addicts just flee
0,A student filmmaker enlists a Bgrade actress a delectably divaish MOLLY RINGWALD to complete the horror film that her mother a dreadfully dull Kylie Minogue tried to make 12 years ago Its a curious plot choice to say the least as any Aussie horror fan knows that the genre is sadly lacking in women directors The film has a curse on it because Molly had to kill some psycho murderer on the original set But shes back because she needs the exposure Unfortunately the curse is still there and people start dying on the set Cut is an Aussie attempt at the modern slasher but unfortunately it doesnt bring anything new or exciting to the table In fact it rips half of Wes Cravens 90s filmography Lots of filmworld namedropping a la Scream except its Aussie namedroppingJane Campionsee how this isnt as funny and lots of is this real or is this a movie a la New Nightmare The editing is bad the music is annoying the effects are laughable almost everything is bad about this Fortunately the film can have a sense of humor at one point a welldressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at Dont worry well treat your house as if it were our own to which he responds that doesnt mean anything to me you look like you live in a dump Ha And Mollys ridiculous oneliners were enough to not regret renting this one You got any diet coke in here as she rides in the film professors car and Does anyone know where I can buy any tofu the first thing she mutters on the set and Where the hell is my agent oh wait thats what I was thinking for her
0,This is one of the more unromantic movies I have ever seen Casting Richard Gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles anymore Diane looks a bit eager to please and frowning as usual but she seems unconvinced by the romance herself Supporting cast not too memorable Story The medical drama he has to deal with is unconvincing and is not interesting The story is weak  not enough happens to make a movie about There is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here  The setting is a little bleak and the house it is set in is unattractive  NOT destined to be a great one to remember
0,It should come as no shock to you when I say that Alone in the Dark is a crappy movie To put it bluntly its as if a dung monster defecated ate the result and then vomited The final product would still outshine this movie Seemingly based on an ancient  Atari video game the movie has something or other to do with a portal to the bowels of the earth the unleashing of demons and ancient civilizations Something about there being two worlds that of darkness and that of light Guess which ones ours Oh and 10000 years ago a really superduper advanced civilization opened the portal demons came over and had a blast then wiped out the civilization Which is why weve never heard of them conveniently enough Christian Slater perhaps pining for the days of Heathers and Pump up the Volume plays Edward Carnby a paranormal researcher to whom Something Bad happened when he was 10 years old Hes hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of said advanced civilization Carnby used to be part of a secret institution called 713 which has been trying to figure out what happened to that longago civilization But Carnby believed he wasnt going to be able to find the answers he sought so he left the group But see these beasties are out and they get their prey in varying ways such as gutting them splitting them down the middle implanting neurological control devices in them or just turning them into killing zombies Yes its another zombie movie Thats about as distilled I can make the plot Its pretty convoluted and incomprehensible In similar movies one might see the intrepid researcheradventurer figure things out a step at a time and when we the audience are mentally with the researcher its a lot of fun But when the scenes shift from attack to attack with no perspective or context not so much fun The acting is dreadful save for Slater who although he almost seems embarrassed to be in the movie showed he was capable of carrying the acting load He had to get this  Tara Reid is cast as a museum curator Honest to goodness I thought Id seen the casting of a lifetime when Denise Richards was cast as a nuclear physicist in Tomorrow Never Dies But Reid here matches Richards crappy emoting for crappy emoting Hightlights include Reid pronouncing Newfoundland as New Fownd Land Reid delivering most of her lines in a dazed throaty monotone kinda like shed been on an allnight bender for the past week before filming Reid  a museum curator mind you  spending a lot of the movie in a midriffbearing top and hiphugger jeans Oh yeah she was as believable as Jessica Simpson giving stock quotes Oh why must the pretty ones be so dumb Note I dont think Tara Reids all that good looking She looks like shes in perpetual need of food Almost everyone else in the cast is completely forgettable except perhaps for Steven Dorff who played Burke one of the leaders of 713 Dorffs character wasnt terribly well developed but nothing in the movie was from the sets to the characters to Tara Reid But I digress Anyway the perplexing and utterly preposterous storyline is tough enough to follow with the film moving at such a breakneck pace but director Uwe Boll tosses in a pounding minddeadening soundtrack its so loud you cant hear what the actors are saying in some of the scenes That cant be right Given the acting level however perhaps thanks are in order to Mr Boll Oh and a fun note The opening moments of the movie include narration of the words that are crawling across the screen at the same time Remember the first Star Wars You heard that nowfamiliar Star Wars theme while the prologue crawled There was surely no need for narration why do I need some doofus to read whats on the screen for me Were the producers simply looking out for blind people Maybe that also explains why the soundtrack was so loud  they were also looking out for hardofhearing people Also the narrator inexplicably had a lisp for the first few lines of the crawl  then lost it Bizarre Alone in the Dark is a loud dopey mishmash of dreadful acting an incoherent script and hamhanded directing Hardly a note rings true Theres so much chaos that the audience simply gives up caring about the characters and roots for their demise Even in the dark the demonic creatures seem cooler and much more developed by comparison Ironically since there were only three other people in the theater I watched this Alone in the Dark I wonder if Uwe Boll planned it that way I cant quite give this the lowest rating because I had low hopes for it to begin with  and because it never grabbed me enough for me to get worked up about it Its atrocious although Slater redeems himself a tiny bit

1,Rowan Atkinson delivers an unforgettable performance as the clueless Mr Bean who never goes far without his Teddy Bear The appeal of Mr Bean is largely his childish behavior and innocence We dont know if he came from the sky or another planet He is the kind of strange character that you cant make up quite easily He is often alone and used to it He has a hard time communicating through speech which might be why we only hear his grunts at times There are other characters who speak to him and he responds The character of Mr Bean is a mystery and still is He lives alone and does the unthinkable when he can do the sensible thing Mr Bean is rather an odd man out who does not mind it much He rather live a simple life with his yellow car and teddy bear and hopes to get to work on time
1,When I bought my Toy Story tape when it came out to Video after being released in theaters I saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of Toy Story As soon as I saw that I knew this was gonna be a good feature I was right A Bugs Life like Toy Story is great story great characters and great animation My favorite characters are Dim the rhino Beetle voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar voiced by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft My favorite scene is when Slim the walking stick David Hyde Pierce lifts up Hemlich trying to distract the Bird and Hemlichs like You hoo Mr Early Bird How about a nice tasting worm on a stick and Slims like Im going to snap Im going to snap I just died laughing at that scene Being a big fan of insects I think A Bugs Life is my favorite Pixar even though I know a lot of people consider it the worst Pixar film ever I dont know how you could hate a Pixar film I think theyre all pretty good films Good job PIXAR
1,The above line sums it up pretty good The best assets of the comics are its visual gags and wordjokes the latter of which are almost impossible to translate which is why the comics are at their best in their original language Both are quite hard to capture in film which is why those will never be as good as the comics Movies are simply a different medium than comics With that in mind this movie does surprisingly well in capturing the fun of the comic The word gags are bearable and sometimes even funny Debouze does an Amelie reference I have to mention that I watched the french version If you dont watch the french version or your lack of understanding of the french language limits you to the subtitles the word jokes will probably suck The slapstick is okay as well its a very simple form of humor and not really funny when youre older than twelve but it captures the spirit of the comicbooks The other visual jokes are the movies saving grace for the older audience as their often quite funny The acting is totally over the top but again thats not annoying at all as it captures the spirit of the comicbooks Only Depardieu and Clavier dont really overact which might be the reason some people think they didnt enjoy their roles I didnt notice a thing On the other hand Jamel Debouze and especially Claude Rich turn overacting into an artform Its actually fun to watch Again I fear it wouldnt be nearly as funny when the voices are dubbed Overall not a bad movie at all much better than the previous one Its not a classic and it doesnt dethrone The Twelve Tasks of Asterix as my favourite Asterix movie but its still worth seeing The french version that is 710
0,I saw this film over the weekend and while I was impressed as always with the beauty and polish of Churchproduced films I left disappointed that this one fell so short failing to inform members and leaving investigators with many unanswered questions The film is 70 minutes of vignettes from the life of Joseph Smith Its not a true biopic because theres no real coherent narrative Most of the episodes concern Joseph doing good deeds playing baseball running races and laughing with children often in sloooow motion What a great just folks kind of guy that Joseph was huh Look at him out there beating rugs for his wife Emma Well howzbout the rugs of his 33 plural wives No mention whatsoever is made of polygamy A glaring omission And it is in such omissions where the film falters It supplies too little information and leaves critical thinking audience members wondering WHY is Joseph getting tarred and feathered WHY is he getting thrown in jail and WHY does that mob want to kill him The films climax is of course Joseph and Hyrums trek to Carthage jail riding past a veritable United Nations of faces looking out from Nauvoos doorways But no mention is ever made about WHY Nothing about Smith suppressing the Nauvoo Expositor newspaper and ordering its press destroyed for its revealing the secret teaching of polygamy The audience is left to wonder or to assume its just more baseless persecution of the Church No mention of Joseph being charged with treason for declaring martial law and calling out the Nauvoo militia Of course I certainly did not expect this Churchproduced film to present the Joseph of Richard Bushmans recent biography Rough Stone Rolling but I was surprised and taken aback at just how little of substance was actually presented And worse what substance that was presented was often inaccurate Two examples jumped out at me First the translation of the Book of Mormon The film shows Joseph reading right off the golden plates in their tworing binder which plates in reality were hidden far from the site Its well known that Joseph did his translating by burying his face in his hat peering at the seer stone in there The second inaccuracy occurs at Carthage jail where the mob storms the cell The History of the Church reports that Joseph had a sixshooter and even fired off a few rounds before jumping out the window and giving the Masonic signal of distress as reported in Times  Seasons Maybe showing the reality of the gunfight would have shattered the hearttugging mood the filmmakers had created but by omitting it they were unfaithful to history and failed to show Joseph as he really was handy with a gun and able to defend himself In fact the impression the film gives is that Joseph was a nice guy but also something of a milquetoast that everybody beat up tossed in jail and eventually murdered in cold blood He was far from that Joseph was a disciplined and determined man who endured a lot of hardship and struggle to bring to fruition that in which he believed See the film but know going in thats its cotton candy Then get your meat and potatoes by reading a copy of Bushmans biography of Smith Rough Stone Rolling  PS Churchproduced films have no credits but seasoned eyes can pick out a couple familiar faces Rick Macy is excellent as Joseph Smith Sr and Bruce Newbold beloved as Thomas in Finding Faith in Christ here plays the cranky Methodist minister who failed to show Christian love to a young seeker after Truth
0,ExCUSE me but my tongue was TOO in my cheek when we filmed this piece o poop As the evil sister with hair that Mommy Dearest would envy I did my very best to channel Tim Curry in Rocky Horror Im sad that this did not come across Ah well a friend compared it to a rock bottom budget SHOWGIRLS with a white hot spoon Ill have to be content with that  What amazes me is no one mentioned the endless and dull wet Tshirt contest It is seriously the longest wet Tshirt contest in cinema history And the only one where the contestants were wearing industrial strength cottonpolyester shirts that defied all efforts to get them wet and translucent  And didnt anyone catch the directors cameo as the dude on the payphone interrupted by our hero With the line are we filming yet clearly audible Jeez this is bad movie heaven for REAL aficionados
1,Real cool smart movie I loved Sheedys colors especially the purple car Alice Drummond is Wise And Wonderful as Stella I liked Sheedys reference to how her face had gotten fatter The roadside dance scene is brilliant Really liked this one
0,Feh This movie started out in an interesting manner but quickly ran the gamut from confusing to dull The confusing parts happened mostly at the beginning where the cut scenes are so numerous that its hard to tell just what is going on for the first twenty minutes or so The dull comes later with a tepid romance between the two living peoplepusses both The vengeful spirit of the dead girl is actually the most lively person in the film which is sad If the rest of the cast had been up to her caliber the movie might have been better Maybe Because the storyline gets really interesting for awhile as it appears that the insane priestess mother of the dead sixteen year old girl is trying to resurrect her daughter from the dead with the decidedly unfortunate side effect that all of the other dead people would come back as well take on solid human form and most likely start killing off everybody A sort of Japanese mystical Night of the Living Dead type thing But this doesnt come to pass Even though this hairy unwashed priest with a tiny basket strapped to his head tells the uninteresting young people that this will come to pass if the priestess finishes her ritual she does just that and the only dead person who manifests is her daughter No mass rising of the dead no walking army of corpses nothing The priest merely makes the girls spirit go back to the land of the dead taking the washed out wuss of a boyfriend with her as shed crushed his spine like peanut brittleat which point I was tempted to cheer loudly as this idiot went over to kiss and fondle the DEAD girlewwww The Robitussen sucking spineless best friend has a long introspective shot at the end as she leaves the village for the last time and thats it No real horror no real creepiness which the Japanese tend to do far better than American film makers with their emphasis on overthetop cheesy face makeup no screaming mimis I was very disappointed
1,Despite its pedigree the most interesting things about this series are not the animatronics or puppetry which while charming are little more than sideshows at least in the story I saw A STORY SHORT In fact loathe though I am to admit it the programmes chief pleasure lies in that most ancient art storytelling John Hurt in Rowley Birken QCmode grotesque medieval makeup relates a story about story telling seated by the fire accompanied by a cynical dog One winters day starving and poor he spots a fellow beggar thrown out of the Royal Kitchen by the nasty cook The Story Teller tricks this latter into giving them an excellent soup Furious the Cook pleads with the King for permission to boil the villain but pleased with the Story Tellers wit the monarch offers him a reprieve  for 100 nights he must tell the King a new story if he fails to do so he will hand him over to the cook The story may be old but its told with great gusto Anthony Minghellas script is excellently dramatic as befits a playwright witty and with some disturbing concerns beneath the fun such as fears for the self or the culturally selfgenerating power of storytelling linked to the continuation of ideological power For a programme aimed at children it is bracingly selfreflexive with little nonsense about film being the new oral culture despite the Americanised style there is a charming sense of medieval bustle its grotesqueness and arbitrary terror as well as its magic and power
0,This film may have been the biggest letdown Ive experienced in renting movies based on IMDb reviews Overall I simply found this to be a secondrate movie Leslie Cheung is certainly passable as the antihero and Ma Wu handles his character with cheerful competence On the other hand Ma Wus makeup facial hair is so obviously phony that I simply could not take him seriously He looked like an overweight teenager dressed up for Halloween complete with the 495 stickon beard The special effects were soso though the undead in the cellar were pretty good The treetongue looked like something from a bad 1950s monster flick though the POV shots from the tongues view more closely resembled Sam Raimis trademark shots in the more recent Evil Dead trilogy The pyrotechnics were hohum and the final battle is about as dull as you can get In fact it most closely reminded me of the Lost in Space episode where the Robinsons are caught in a sandstorm and  The plot was not particularly original and has been told countless times in the form of European fairy tales There was no suspense and no plot twists In fact you know right away as you are introduced to the characters who is good who is bad and who is going to survive I just returned this film to Netflix and then I sat down to write this review The very first thing I did was check the production date Yep it says 1987not the 1967 that I thought it might be And that pretty much sums it up The production values and FX are typical of the 1960s The plot and action seem much older as Hollywood was actually producing some interesting and challenging films in the 60s  out of 
1,This is one of those films that explore the culture clash of Eastern born people in Westernized cultures  Loving on Tokyo Time is a sad film about the inability of opposites to attract due to major cultural differences Ken rock nroll fanatic marries Kyoto a Japanese girl so that she can stay in the United States when her visa expires The marriage is only expected to be temporary that is until Kyoto gains legal status again But Ken who seems to be lost in every relationship takes a liking to Kyoto and tries very hard to make things work out This despite his friends urging that dumping Kyoto and getting rid of all commitments to girls is bad for rock n roll except to inspire some song writing about broken hearts and all of that But Kyoto comes from a strict traditional Japanese upbringing and doesnt expect to be married to Ken all that long Not only that she is homesick and wants to return to Japan Its sad in that this is finally someone Ken thinks he can love and be with and all that except the one time he thinks hes found someone to feel that way about the girl isnt expecting to stay that long Its not that she doesnt like Ken its just that shes used to a whole nother way of life She says I cant tell him the way I feel in English and Ken cant tell me the way he feels in Japanese Its a rather sad love story with a killer 80s technonintendo soundtrack I picked up Loving on Tokyo Time because it reminded me of one of my favorite 80s films Tokyo Pop And for those of you who enjoyed Loving on Tokyo Time check out Tokyo Pop a New York singer goes to Japan and joins a Japanese American cover band except its a movie with a happy ending 
1,Sure for its super imagery and awesome sound its a great home theater show off disk but this is also a touching drama as well as an informative documentary The parallel stories that are intertwined throughout this film will keep all viewers interested Young old boys and girls alike will find that deep down we are all fans of the automobile especially the high performance indy machines that are the result of generations blood sweat tears ingenuity and perseverance The Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder sound track is perfectly matched to the visuals and the content I dont want to give away the ending but the final driving sequence to Quincy Jones Days Like These just might bring a tear to your eye Enjoy it
0,This ones a doozy Dating from 1949 Scene of the Crime often plays more like a Coen Bros movie set in the 1940s and filmed in black and white except that the writers ear for pastiche here isnt quite so welltuned  maybe this can be seen instead as the forerunner to Oscarbaiting schlock like Road to Perdition Frankly its a wonder that this film isnt considered a classic by film professors and critics everywhere considering how much it offers in term of overly articulated mannerist thrills cloaked in false significance  much like the grandaddy of all such fake art films Citizen Kane or anything by Murnau   MGM is usually a studio that can do no wrong in my eyes and I think any story any atmosphere even gritty realism can only benefit from grotesque overaestheticization You could say Im a disciple of the Minnelli school But it takes a certain light touch to write mannered toughguy dialogue of the Dashiell Hammett stripe a willingness perhaps to let maybe one or two scenes pass without a line like Careful Mr Wiggly or youll have thirteen fish to fry and no little wormies to catch them with I made most of that up  Mr Wiggly unfortunately made the cut  but believe me the dialogue is just that loonily inflated and riddled with non sequiturs Even the lead cops wife played by Arlene Dahl speaks like she has a moonshaped scar under one eye and the Christian name Rocco By the time Van Johnson turns in his badge with the line Im sick to death of death and homicide youll wonder how the writers fixation with ornate literary devices  in this case zeugma  could ever have been misconstrued as street  For those who have outgrown The Naked Gun series this is the funniest copsnrobbers film going
1,My wife and I struggle to find movies like this that are clean and yet enjoyable for adults If you cant find a cinema that is playing it call your cinema and request it Bravo Five Sisters Productions for courage tenacity and creative endeavor
0,This was the second MST3Kd movie I ever saw and still holds a place in my heart as one of the most hilariously awful film experiences you are ever going to have  Miles OKeeffe sp is in this using his chiseled physique to score another payment on the mortgage on his condominium Hes stiff wooden and unconvincing but he still comes across as a cool likable guy and at least hes photogenic Thats the only decent I can find to say about the movie so I thought I would get it out of the way right up front The fact that he is in the movie adds another point to the score and saves it from being a 1 out of 10  In no particular order examples of how badly put together this film is 1OK the Tanya Roberts clone Mila quests to the ends of the earth to find Ator which takes 3 minutes of screen time including the time she spends stumbling around dying from a poisoned arrow in her shoulder which I assume would have slowed her down quite a bit So Ator heals her up and takes his trusty aid Thong and sets out to go back to the her castleand proceeds to take the next 50 minutes of the movie recovering the ground that Mila traversed in 3 minutes How does that work I know that the intrepid crew is being harassed by magical forces and enemies etc on the way back but still 2Apparently the writerdirector felt the need to add depth to the film by adding a running debateSocratic dialoggame of 20 questions between Zor the mean John Saxon wannabe and the wise man Akronas the Richard Harris wannabe But Joe Damoto apparently got his philosophical training from Hallmark cards TShirts and bumper stickers and he doesnt understand tempo pacing or timingand neither do the actors Crows remark during one of these exchanges is the tag line for my entry The scenes with these two drag on and on bringing the movie to a screeching halt and killing any momentum or excitement generated by the swordfighting and questing of the heroic trio 3 Once Ator arrives at the castle and is captured things go even farther downhill Zor decides to feed a bunch of women victims along with Ator and Mila to the Serpent God he keeps in his basement This scene had some potential for excitement so the director immediately kills this potential by instilling the scene with all the drama of people waiting in line at the DMV to pay their traffic fines Ator proceeds to have a big battle with the Serpent that is barely more convincing than Bela Lugosis battle with the rubber octopus puppet in Bride Of The Monster  4 The climactic scene in which Ator invents the hang glider out of twigs and animal skins is so patently silly that it completely blows the viewer out of the movie and makes you roll on the floor laughing until your sides hurt  5 Oh yes and the filmmakers decided to include stock footage of an atomic explosion at the end with the moral that Ator decided to destroy the atomic nucleus McGuffin that drives the movie because mankind was not ready Zzzzip MESSAGE COMING IN Just like Bride Of the Monster again come to think of it All it needed was a bystander to observe They tampered in Gods domain 6 For some reason the version of the movie I saw features introductory and closing homoerotic credit sequences that have absolutely NOTHING to do with anyone or anything else in the movie I have no idea where this footage came from but it is actually WORSE than the actual movie it bookends  Watch this only if you are a big fan of Miles or if you enjoy the way MST3K skewers material like this
0,this film has its good points hot chicks people die the problem the hot Chicks barley get nude and you dont get to see many of the people dieing mostly just lots of fast movements and screaming though there were two good kill scenes also for those of you watching this for JENNA JAMESON she is just a side chearator with a very small role and Minor nude scenes What this film needed script and story would be nice but I will not complain about that simply put it needs more nudity and better kill scenes cuz lets face it that is why we watch these flicks I wouldnt waste my money on itand if you must wait until its on the OLD shelves at your local video store
1,This is a classic action flick from the 80s featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles Set in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything including the television networks One of their most popular TV shows is The Running Man where convicted felons are hunted down and killed for the entertainment of millions Its set up like a game show where the audience votes for their favorite stalkers trained killers who hunt down and kill the shows unlucky contestants Audience members also win prizes for correctly predicting who will be killed by whom And the host is played by none other than Family Feuds Richard Dawson whos game show experience makes him well suited for this role When Ben Richards Arnold is falsely accused of mass murder he is forced to play this sadistic game This movie is chock full of classic Arnold oneliners such as his famous Ill be back right before he enters the arena And he taunts a stalker armed with a flamethrower with How about a light I could go on and on but I dont want to spoil the movie Its funny stuff Whether it was intended or not this movie serves as a great parody of todays Reality TV craze Already there are numerous programs that show people enduring pain and humiliation for the entertainment of viewers and even court cases are televised for their entertainment value Running Man demonstrates what would happen if reality TV hit rock bottom and it is a scary picture One can only hope that the networks have the common sense not to let it go that far Overall this is a fun film  I highly recommend it 9 out of 10

0,Did you ever think like after watching a horror movie with a group of friends Wow this is so cool We have got to make a splatter horror movie ourselves some day soon I bet it isnt as difficult as it seems Well this must have been what went through the minds of the young Campbell brothers back in 2003 presumably right after watching Sam Raimis The Evil Dead or a similar independent horror classic This Demon Summer however is so bad its embarrassing These young amateurish filmmakers obviously worship the horror genre and know their classics but that nearly doesnt make them talented Ive seen quite a lot lousy Bmovies in my years as a horror fanatic but this honestly ranks as one of the biggest pieces of crap ever made And its quite sad to be this openhearted because the whole cast and crew clearly had good intentions Theres pretty much no script at all A duo of thugs simply steals a mysterious book from a bum and whilst reading some passages of it one of them mutates into a hideous demon that starts killing off members of all the different teenagergroups dorks hot Catholic girls stoners and troublemakers Thats about it except of course for all the obligatory clichÃ©s like the hot girl falling for the biggest dork etc etc The performances are really painful to listen to and none of these annoying teenagers use mimicry They just stand there motionless until the script says its their turn to interact I hate that Some of makeup effects are remotely decent but still not spectacular and the soundtrack contains some of the most awful punksongs ever This film should never have been released I can very well imagine that it must have been fun to be a part of the production but its utterly imbecile and doesnt feature the slightest redeeming element Not even a bit of amateurnudity damned

1,Moonwalker is a Fantasy Music film staring Michael Jackson with different segments I will rate each segment individually Segment 1 opens the film with a Music video The Music video is a concert of Michael Jackson performing the song Man in the Mirror the Music video also shows montages of historical figures such as Gandhi Martin Luther king JR John Lennon and more The first segment was a good choice to open the film i liked the song and also loved the montage of the historical figures I even loved the message in the song I give the first segment a 910 Segment 2 shows a montage of Michael Jacksons start from the Jackson five to his solo career The montage i thought was well made i liked the animation they put into it and i also loved their choices of songs such as I I want you back Beat it Thriller can you feel it and the way you make me feel The only thing i wish they could have done a little a better in one of the songs in the montage is We are the world The reason why is all you see is rain drops and in those drops are images of Michael Jackson and the chorus of the celebrities but its a little hard to see the chorus Other than that the segment is still good I give it a 910 Segment 3 is the song Bad Youre probably thinking its Michael Jacksons Music video of badWell yes and no This segment is the Music video but its redone by Kids The segment was cute but it wasnt as good as the other segments I give it a 610 Segment 4 is a short Claymation Music film that takes place after the kids version of bad called Speed Demon The short is about Michael Jackson being chased by his beloved fans and the press and he disguises himself as a rabbit and rides a motorcycle to try to get away from them The claymation in the chase sequence was great but some parts in the film the Claymation characters looked a little fake when they interact with real people Also at the end of the clip out of nowhere Michael Jackson rabbit costume comes to life and hes dancing with it I liked the dancing but that was like out of nowhere I give it a 810 Segment 5 is Michael Jacksons Grammy winning Music video Leave me alone The Music Video is about the media poking their nose at Michael Jacksons personal life and Michael Jackson feels they wont leave him alone no matter how much hes proved innocent The music video really speaks out but keep in mind this happened before the child molestation this just all about the rumors of him in the 80s but i didnt feel this Video should be in this Movie because its a kids Movie and i dont think kids will understand what hes singing about I give this Music video 810 Segment 6 leads us to the main story of the whole movie called Smooth Criminal Michael Jackson plays a gangster who uses his powers of a wishing star as a crime figure to protect children  including John Lennons son Sean Lennon from an Evil Mobster named Mr Bigg Played by Joe Pesci The segment i thought really brought out the film especially when he danced and sang the song Smooth Criminal with a bunch of Criminals I also thought the special effects were good The weird thing about the Segment is why are kids hanging out with a grown man it never explained why Also Joe Pesci character talks about Drugs and what he plans to do with them I mean why would you talk about drugs in a kids film Other wise it was good My rating for this segment is a 810 Segment 7 is the final segment of the whole movie The film ends with Michael Jackson singing a Cover version of the Beatles Song Come Together and then during the credits we see Michael Jackson singing with Ladysmith Black Mambazo Michael did a good cover of Come Together and i think it was good idea putting including a group of good singers with a talented musican like him My rating is 910 This movie is a good Michael Jackson film i think it really brings out children s Imagination The film is almost as Imaginative as the Beatles animated movie Yellow Submarine if you like Michael Jackson and youre up to a film with a lot of creativity this is the film My Overall rating for this movie is 810
0,I see that the majority of the comments so far have been if not overly positive then at least positive I can not understand that The only explanation I can find is that the people who commented had something to do with the film because this is one of the worst movies Ive ever seen It makes Boggy Creek II and Mutant look like masterpieces of horror The acting is shaky at best and awful for the most part The entire movie is almost pitch black probably so they could shoot it all in the same location The monster looks like something from one of Roger Cormans worst films And the plotwell the less said about it the better One to avoid at all costs
1,This movie is sort of similar to Better Off Dead as it has some of the same stars This one though isnt quite as good Granted it is rather funny and enjoyable there is something about Betterthat I like well better This one has these guys going to Nantucket to spend there summer vacation While there they meet this girl whos trying to save here house from this guy who wants to turn it into a lobster restaurant This guy really doesnt seem to like lobsters cause in one scene he sticks it into boiling water and puts in a stethoscope so he can hear it scream The main character is torn between this girl and the girl of the son of the guy who wants to make the restaurant Somehow or another this leads to a big boat race showdown kind of like in Summer Rental though it works a bit better here and fits into the plot a little better Though what is the deal with boat races at this time Was there some weird fascination with them For the most part this movie delivers laughs at a good clip but Better Off Dead was still better cause it was the first and the jokes worked better

1,I dont watch very many horror movies but one night I sat down and watched this with my cousins Now were teenagers so we tend to make fun of a lot of things but honestly the acting here really wasnt very good especially at the beginning One line that stood out was when Scarlett says to Jill and Tiffany This is so high school while the next scene shows Jill walking past a sign with their High School name on it Many parts at the beginning reminded me of a corny badlywritten badlyacted Lizzie McGuire episode However as the story progressed and the cast moved on to just about only Jill most of the time I was able to appreciate the movie more Camilla Belle did really well in this movie and I think that the other actors and actresses ruined the movie for her And I must admit this was one of the scariest movies Ive ever seen Well no there werent big monsters and white faces appearing in dark corners and possessed dolls but the thing that made this movie scarier than ones containing those things is that it really could happen And this movie really reminded me of what really IS scary We all know were not likely to stumble upon the living dead any time in our lives but the idea of having a murderer inside the house youre babysitting at could really happen The only flaw with this movie is that its one of the most clichÃ© movies Ive ever seen It has everything in it that any horror movie has ever had turning the keys and the car starts shadows in the corner turning the corners of the stairs with suspense turning around and seeing a dead body ending a fatal scene quickly with waking up from a dream etc At the suspenseful scenes it was very predictable but overall I would give it a 710 Its definitely worth seeing By the way This is my first review so I dont know if any of those things were spoilers But just to be safe
0,Boy oh boy oh golly gee The most interesting thing in the movie was the hilarity of the bluescreen effects used to create Moms invisibility They looked like they were shot on cheap video and it looks totally unreal and not even in a good way where its so funny that you end up loving the movie I did NOT end up loving this movie The attempted steadicam shots were really pathetic as well I mean hey if they had a low budget flick thats fine You can still make a great movie with a low budget But a BAD movie and a low budget AND effects That makes for a bad combination In this case such a doomed combo created the craptastic film Invisible Mom If you have kids and your kids have no taste perhaps they will stay awake through all of this one
0,1983 was a bumper year for Stephen King books making it to the big screen Christine The Dead Zone and Cujo were all released within a few months of each other While The Dead Zone was easily the pick of the bunch Christine and Cujo were both pretty bad and its a closerun thing as to which is the lesser of the two If pushed for an answer Id say Cujo  marginally  is the weakest Donna Trenton Dee Wallace fresh from success as Elliots mom in ET  The Extra Terrestrial is a mother whose marriage to husband Vic Daniel HughKelly is hanging by a thread Shes been having an affair with a local worker and is now dwelling on whether or not to leave her husband Dragged into the marital heartache is young Tad Trenton Danny Pintauro son of Donna and Vic and a pretty messedup kid with a chronic phobia of the dark which often leads to severe panic attacks Donna and Tad take the family car to a nearby mechanics yard for repairs but as they arrive their car splutters to a halt Things get a heck of a lot worse when they discover that the mechanic Joe Camber Ed Lauter isnt there he has been savagely killed by his pet dog Cujo a gigantic St Bernard which was recently bitten and infected by a rabid bat Soon the dog has them trapped in their car and is trying everything to get inside the vehicle to tear apart these two hapless victims The weather is swelteringly hot not a living soul knows theyre there the car wont start and the dog seriously wants their blood Cujo has potential to be a genuinely taut siege thriller but it never really clicks into gear Ive read the book and it is quite disappointing  certainly for King  so its hardly surprising that the film version amounts to so little On the printed page King was at least able to generate a degree of tension but the film is critically hampered by the fact that a St Bernard simply isnt very scary The visualness of the film medium serves as a constant reminder that Cujo IS a St Bernard In the book it was possible to forget this In the book Cujo sometimes almost seemed to assume the guise of a monster Even with the relatively short runningtime of an hourandahalf Cujo becomes a tedious and patiencestraining experience occasionally unintentionally funny and certainly never as suspenseful as it would like to be Theyve even omitted the books cruelly downbeat ending and replaced it with an alls well that ends well conclusion so that audiences can go home in a cheerful mood Chalk this one down as yet another inferior King adaptation
1,I saw this film some years ago and promptly bought the soundtrack because it was simply excellent Bacharachs music is endearing and should be given the recognition it richly deserves The cinematography is awesome Critics hated it but they hated HOME ALONE too I havent found it on video but welcome anyone who can find a copy
1,I couldnt agree more with the other comment its like Falling down Peter Weller is OK and William Hurt great as always except in Lost in Space This is a good movie With pretty good performances Very recommendable If you like Falling down youre going to enjoy this one 8 of 10
1,I must say every time I see this movie I am deeply touched not only by the most painful four years of Hongshengs life but also by how his family deals with his drug addiction It is also true that getting addicted to anything such as drugs alcohol or pornography cannot only hurt you but also hurt your most important people in the world your family Since family is the 1 priority in the Asian culture it takes guts for the circle to gather together and show one person how much the family loves himher this is actually the first Chinese movie that I actually enjoy not for the fun of it but the elements surrounding it superb acting touching story great direction make this movie worth watching What stands out the most is that Hongsheng and his family act out the story themselves instead of having some Bmovie actor trying to imitate the real person It shows the genuineness of the movie
0,Recently I saw the documentary The revolution will not be televised also know as ChÃ¡vez inside the coup At first I thought it showed a genuine inside view of events during the Venezuela coup of April 2002 What bothered me though was the fact that the tone of the narration and the accompanying music were suggestive and that at no point any criticism was expressed about Hugo ChÃ¡vez This is peculiar because if a documentary is giving an nonbiased account of what happened there should have been some of that too After all ChÃ¡vez certainly is not a saint Fortunately since the documentary is several years old a lot of additional information is available on the internet nowadays and it was not difficult to find for instance Urgent Investigation about Chavezthe coup by the 5 European TV Corporations who financed the film which presents blatant falsehoods about Venezuela It lists the many errors and intended or unintended falsifications in the documentary Just use the title as a search string in Google you will find it Another interesting document was the video registration of a presentation of the findings of the many errors in this documentary Xray of a lie To me it seems to be a good counterweight to ChÃ¡vez inside the coup Its available at videogoogle I strongly advice you after watching ChÃ¡vez inside the coup to look at Xray of a lie and then form your opinion My conclusion is that Kim Bartley and Donnacha OBrian were knowingly or not part in ChÃ¡vezpropaganda
1,Christopher Smith is an obvious horror fan and this is made clear in his debut horror flick Creep Creep although a little bit loose on information proves itself worthy of a true gory classic A little less glossy than recent US horrors Amityville Horror remake House of Wax remake this dark and gruesome tale follows Kate Franka Potente through the labyrinth of underground tunnels and disused railways as she and a number of others along the way try and flee a murderous attacker Though some bad reviews have slated this film I truly believe that on a tight budget and for a UK production from first time director Smith that Creep truly does live up to its name It delivers fastpaced gory action more or less from the beginning sometimes too fast as the story is patchy in some areas but with a perfect location and the best characterreactionattheend Ive seen in a while Creep delivers some scenes that are definitely the stuff of nightmares
1,Bell Book and Candle was shown recently on cable Not having seen it for a while we decided to take another look at this comedy Based on the James Van Drutens Broadway hit which was a vehicle for Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in the early fifties the film was adapted for the screen by Daniel Taradash The film was directed by Richard Quine who turned the play into a delightful comedy Evidently judging by some of the comments submitted by IMDb the big issue seems to be the pairing of the two stars who had collaborated on Vertigo released the same year Movie audiences didnt think anything about the age difference when this film was released In fact most of the aging male stars of that period were always involved with much younger women The film set in Manhattan during Christmas is a delightful comedy that has enchanted viewers Kim Novak was at the height of her beauty as its clear the camera adored her no matter what was she playing As the witch that becomes human her Gillian is charming James Stewart who plays the publisher Shep Henderson is also seen at his best Mr Stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows in here why he was at the top In supporting roles the wonderful Elsa Lanchester playing Queenie is a welcome addition to any movie as she proves here Jack Lemmons Nicky Holroyd the brother of Gillian is also good Ernie Kovacs is also seen as the writer Sidney Radlitch This is an excellent way to spend a winter night at home watching Bell Book and Candle
1,As a guy who has seen all the seasons I can say that JG constantly surprises me I mean after you saw him shifting from laughter to paranoia instantly throughout the seasons and after every little gesture of his made u believe he is a gangster u thought to yourself OK he is a good actor and he can get into a gangsters skin But after seeing him opening his eyes and struggling for his life I mean I could almost feel the pain he made us believe he was going through I was so touched by his performance that I immediately thought at Robert De Niro Marlon Brando and Al Pacino These guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more But nowadays they are either old or dead Brando and its OK that they make less movies and their performances are lighter than they used to be I cant wait to see Gandolfini in other movies where he delivers a totally different role Can u recommend me some of his older movies where he gives a memorable performance
1,What can I say An excellent end to an excellent series It never quite got the exposure it deserved in Asia but by far the best cop show with the best writing and the best cast on televison EVER The end of a great era Sorry to see you go
0,I shouldnt even review this movie since its not actually a horror movie  and thus not worthy of Dr Cheeses attention At least its not horror in the usual sense Its certainly a horrifying proposition to waste your time watching this crap Thats why I turned it off after the first four hours Imagine my surprise then when the clock showed that only 45 minutes had passed Yep thats right in plain terms this movie is boring The Order had lots of flaws not all of them unique In particular it seems to me the main problem with the religious subgenre of horror films is Hollywoods unwillingness to engage Christianity on its own terms It is quite possible to make truly creepy films that are also orthodox Just ask William Peter Blatty In fact without orthodoxy films like this are just an anythinggoes smorgasbord of the filmmakers usually dull and illogical imaginations Think about it If someone made a movie ostensibly about say physics but not only got the basic laws of physics wrong but based the entire plot on its wrong portrayals you would soon get tired of the resulting pointless plot The same goes for these sorts of movies In other words The Orderand many similar movies before it invent out of whole cloth stuff about the Catholic Church and about the Christian faith and attempt to build a plot out of these inventions Unsurprisingly the plot ends up being incoherent and stupid This movie has the added charm of being as interesting to watch as your toenails growing Avoid this steaming pile
0,First of all this film can be divided into three segments A promising opening with the ambushing of some cavalry by the Cheyenne This is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section with the totally miscast Candice Bergen and Soldier Blue traveling together to reach the safety of an Army garrison Miss Bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth and looks like she just walked out of a 1970s Jack Nicholson movie I mean she maintains zero interest with zero believability The third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an Indian village This is so obviously overdone to lay on the antiwar propaganda that it comes across as simply long outrageous and contrived Not recommended  MERK Jacobe comment above Heres an idea Why dont you actually watch the movie you are commenting on instead of chirping your liberal nonsense This is not a political site it is for reviewing films  MERK
1,Somewhere near the bottom of the film studio ladder you can find companies like UFO Troma and beneath them lie Seduction cinema Seduction is a direct to video production company that specialize in lesbian themed nonhardcore erotic movies It has developed a very dedicated fan base that purchase each new title as they are released but sadly the company has become too closely associated with frequent star Misty Mundae I say sadly because recent mainstream interest and her appearance on the show Masters of Horrors has caused her to set her sights a little higher than the zero budget SC efforts which forces the company to find a new identity But back in their glory days they released this film on a very appreciative world The gorgeous Misty Mundae is forced to attend a boarding school at the request of a absent father At the school she meets her absurdly hot roommate played by Ruby Larocca who immediately has designs on her but the headmistress Barbara Joyce has other plans In typical SC style the movie stops every ten minutes for a extended sex scene but unlike most of their efforts this one has a somewhat interesting story and a couple of good performances Ms Larocca appears to be having a great time as the sexual predator who views Misty as a tasty meal and Darian Caine makes a welcome though brief appearance as Satan This is the sort of film that Jess Franco would crank out in the 70s although this one does not have the hardcore sex that Franco was always willing to throw in for foreign sales and fans of that madmans work would be wise to give this one a go To me as a long time zero budget cinema fan and Troma worshiper I came across the Seduction cinema films through their parody films Playmate of the apes Who wants to be a erotic billionaire but I actually prefer their more original works You either see past the low budget and occasionally weak acting or you get hung up on these things and just hate all of these films For me the most obvious thing that unites these nobudget movies is a real sense of fun These low budget companies are able to create their own unique style which gives the viewer something very different from the bland by the numbers studio efforts that load up the multiplexes If you have never seen a Seduction cinema film either this or Sin Sisters featuring both of the Mundae sisters are excellent choices to begin with This one is a fun fast paced film although the frequent exterior shots of the school do get a little old and the DVD is totally loaded with extras including a ton of previews of other company offerings a great behind the scenes featurette and some deleted scenes including a alternate opening I do recommend you pass on the discs bonus feature the first film by director as it is quite weak and not really worth viewing
1,WriterDirector John Hughes covered all bases as usual with this bittersweet Sunday Afternoon family movie Curly Sue is a sweet precocious orphan cared for from infancy by Bill The pair live off their wits as they travel the great US of A Fate matches them with a very pretty yuppie lawyer and the rest is predictable Kids will love this film as they can relate to the heroine played by 9 year old Alisan Poter who went on to be the you go girl of Pepsi commercials The character is supposed to be about 6 or 7 as she is urged to think about going to school Some of her vocabulary suggests that she is every day of 9 or older Similar to Home Alone there is plenty of slapstick and little fists punching big fat chins Again this is formula film making aimed at a young audience Entertaining and heartwarming Dont look for any surprises but be prepared to shed a tear or two
0,This film is based on the novel by John Fante Could someone please tell me why I see absolutely no reason why this fine book should be adapted in this way If you want to make a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek then how could you possibly make a connection to Ask The Dust the novel And if you wanted to make this story into a film then why would you want to make it into a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek I dont get it The adaptation of the story is poorly made and if you have read the book and liked it Im almost sure you wont like what Towne did with it  In the beginning of the film youll maybe find the casting odd the acting bad and the cinematography just a bit overdone But you hope for the best I really hoped a lot during this film I actually wanted it to be good But it only gets worse and it is as simple as that Whether you read Fantes novel or not this is not a good film Just another romantic melodramatic Hollywood production combined with bad acting lack of structure and  of course  plenty of shots of Colin Farells naked butt I could complain a lot more about this film but why waste my time Ive seen it Alright I had to see it because I like the book so much and was curious And Im very disappointed 110 is for Colins sweet little mustache in the end of the film So sweet Had he worn it the whole time through Id given it 210
1,Cypher is a cleverly conceived story about industrial espionage set in America in the not too distant future While thematically not complex this film does offer many different perspectives about personal loyalty ruthlessness and corporate conspiracy To a certain extent this film also attempts to represent modern corporate groups and companies as being indifferent to the risks their contract employees take on their behalf The film starts off with a somewhat mediocre salary man Morgan Sullivan Jeremy Northam who applies to the Digicorp group to work as an undercover operative After an initial briefing with Digicorps Security Chief Sullivan is then given a new identity Jack Thursby and sent to a business conference with the task of recording the speeches given by various spokesmen concerning the marketing strategies of each of their respective companies Upon successfully completing his first assignment SullivanThursby is sent on further missions to obtain the same type of information previously gathered However on one of his business trips he inadvertently runs into a woman named Rita Foster Liu whom he had met on his previous assignment and from there things go extremely topsyturvy The implications of a diabolical conspiracy involving Digicorps espionage program begin to emerge and Sullivan is forced to go deep cover at one of Digicorps main competitors thus becoming a double agent involved in an intense rivalry between the two companies SPOILERS END HERE What I liked most about this film was the efficient use of lighting and shadows in a lot of the scenes Vivid lighting was used in mainly domestichousehold settings while a lot of shadows and dark coloring were used for settings involving deception and coverup I was also very impressed with Jeremy Northam Not too often have I seen him in the lead role and the fact that he plays a disenchanted married man straight out of Wisconsin was brilliant Personally I think hes one of the many under used actors in the industry who hasnt been given more challenging roles Lucy Liu was also incredible in her part and gave the movie its real cloakanddagger tone Additionally the rest of the supporting cast did a superb job however my only complaint was that some characters could have been explored more to make the plot and closure a little more complicated For example I would have loved to see what would have happened if Jack Thursby had developed a more intimate relationship with his second wife Overall this is a cleverly developed cloakanddagger story that keeps you guessing to the very end about personal and professional loyalties and whether anyone in the entire film can be trusted With a smart and stylish soundtrack and great camera work this film provides a scary look at how corporations might operate in the near future Im surprised that I had never watched this hidden gem before This is a brilliant nottoooverly complicated spy thriller and therefore Im giving it a 9 out of 10
0,Opulent sets and sumptuous costumes well photographed by Theodor Sparkuhl and a good not great performance by Jannings as Henry cannot overcome poor writing and static camerawork Henny Porten chews the scenery as Anne Its all very beautiful but its all surface and no depth The melodramatic tale of a woman wronged made it a hit in America where the expressionistic The Cabinet of Dr Caligari flopped in the same year 1920 proving that what is popular is not what endures Lubitsch would be remembered for his lively comedies not sterile spectacles like this
0,This movie is 1 in the list of worst movies I have ever seen with Lessons for an Assassin on the 2 spot The acting is lousy sorry Sandra Bullock but even your performance was horrible the music score could have come from a bad xrated movie and the story was downright ridiculous It had this in common with a typical action movie the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of onesyllable words But contrary to the average action movie there was no real action in this one Boring The only reason I continued watching it was in the hopes that at one point there would be at least one interesting scene in this movie  Thumbs down on this one
1,Ive loved all of Creams work even as there is such a small and precious catalog of work to take hold Even when they go for as long as twenty minutes with some of their songs Spoonful and Toad off of Wheels of Fire are prime examples still rock the socks off of more than half of any given rock act working today This power to gel on stage is given one of the most anticipate rock band reunions ever with their Royal Albert Hall shows last year They may have gotten older as have their fans but the energy is still there with the great arrangements of classic blues songs as well as their own The renditions of White Room Badge Politician Spoonful Sunshine of Your Love not one seems to miss a beat Claptons solos have a formation that he sometimes doesnt have when on stage with his solo band Ginger Baker enough said Jack Bruce is sturdy enough with his vocals still with a kind of power that Clapton could never get on his own Bottom line if you want to see what were the best shows you wish you had seen last year well some may have seen them its all on this DVD with cool special features
0,I have never panned a film online but I felt moved to do so after seeing this one One doesnt show up at someones funeral and say to the bereaved My relatives died so why should I care about yours Minus the propaganda there was little if anything that could be called art As the daughter of deaf parents I was particularly annoyed by the use of deafness as a gimmick Any deaf person feeling a vibration of that immensity would likely have investigated not ignored it The word chutzpah comes to mind As a writer there are few subjects I would stay away from the Holocaust is one this is another I wish these movie makers had not been so arrogant and inept
0,watch a team of bomb disposal experts in Iraq count down their time before they can go home That in itself sounds boring Every time that little caption came up telling us how long they had left it just caused this film with no plot to drag on and on hurry up and finish your time there so we can all go home I must be missing something Im a great fan of war films if they are done well This had jarhead syndrome A film that at times was beautifully shot but cinematography doesnt stop it from being totally dull and pointless And get over the slow mo cartridges coming out of the gun shot already they could have saved money and just got stock footage from any other film with a gun in it I didnt have any empathy for the main guy in it i was constantly hoping that his recklessness would cause him to die In fact the film would have worked much better if he had I read some reviews and seemed to get the feeling that those who had been in the armed forces disliked it and everyone else loved it I have never been in the forces and Im with them Its pretentious drivel the 3 stars are for the cinematography
1,After all the crap that Hollywood and the Indies have churned out we finally get a movie that delivers some scary moments There are some clichÃ©d moments but Im not sure its possible nowadays to make an entirely original movie Theres not much new hereits just done well Make sure and pay attention as the subtle scares come quickly and often This is not a movie to watch while youre eating pizza Theres one very wellwritten red herring in this movie and unfortunately one very poorlycast role Cheri Christian just doesnt make an effective Julie the wifemother For one thing shes totally unsympathetic I know I knowshes just gone through a traumatic experience But the viewer never gets to know her as she normally is and the relationship between her and her husband is rather discomforting in an unintentional way I think that the director had meant for us to have some sympathy for her but I never did Finally a thumbsup for the ending which is both disturbing and satisfying It could easily have been cheapened with a sound effect at the beginning of the end credits but the director wisely resisted This is not a masterpiece by any means but it IS a good oldfashioned scary moviesomething thats rather rare nowadays
0,Well were to start This is by far one of the worst films Ive ever paid good money to see I wont comment on the story itself its a wonderful classic but here it feels like a soap opera To start with the acting except for Eric Bana is soap opera quality Ive always been a fan of Brad Pitt but here every actor on The Bold and the Beautiful puts him to shame The camera action doesnt help either How it lingers on him when hes thinking it just takes me back to Brooke Forresters days in the lab Peter OToole has either had a really bad plastic surgery or he is desperately in need of one Either way he looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans And to end my comments Diane Kruger is a cute girl but she sure is no Helen of Troy Peterson should rather have chosen Saffron Burrows for the role since Elizabeth Taylor would be rather miscast by now
0,It is difficult to rate a writerdirectors first effort After all it is one more movie than I have written or directed James Hunter wrote a story that was interesting but suffered from an uneven flow After all the idea that a man Ja Rule has to choose between the thug life and going straight is common and even falling in love with the daughter Tatyana Ali of the man you killed has been done Doing it again demands something that is original and originality is lacking in this film I was drawn by the inclusion of so many favorites Tia Carrere Trues Lies Waynes World Pam Grier Jackie Brown Frank Langella Dracula Good Night and Good Luck and Ving Rhames Rosewood Dawn of the Dead They did not disappoint in their performances but they had little to work with Direct to video is becoming more and more common but that doesnt mean it has to be a waste of time Maybe the sophomore effort of Hunter will be more enjoyable
1,While Hayao Miyazakis movies have always been hitormiss with me with regards to story they are unequivocally gorgeous to the eye with characters of simple animation against a backdrop of artistic images Ponyo sticks to that formula with a lead character so adorable I want a plush doll of her and scenery so pretty it wouldnt look out of place framed up as a picture on a wall The story on the other hand I didnt enjoy quite as much as his last two widereleases Spirited Away and Howls Moving Castle It was just a tad too juvenile coming across as more for kids and leaving adults to just enjoy the animation I was also disappointed that the score done by Joe Hisaishi who also the scores for the abovementioned two movies wasnt nearly as memorable this time around While I cant quite recall Howls score now I still remember it being one of the most beautiful I had ever heard Ditto Spiriteds  though I only remember it being very complementary to the movie Maybe its because Ponyo is more juvenile fare that the score isnt quite as haunting In any case this movie is still a mustwatch for fans of anime or Miyazaki
0,This show uses a rather tired sitcom formula of the fat idiot blue collar slob with the pretty and sometimes shrewishseeming wife and crazy inlaws With this show its fat unfunny comedian Kevin James as Doug Hefferman who works as a delivery driver for a parcel service He has a pretty wife Carrie Leah Remini who works as legal assistant and senile fatherinlaw Arthur Spooner Jerry Stiller who lives in his daughter and soninlaws basement Kevin James Doug is your typical beer drinking sports loving TV watching slob of a sitcom husband who would rather watch the tube than deal with his marital issues He also has a couple of idiot friends who lend extra stupidity to the problems encountered by this shows couple Beyond the few laughs supplied by Jerry Stillers crazy old man character this show was generally unfunny Kevin James imbecilic behavior usually caused the shows problems that usually resolved by his wife This show continued a run of sitcoms with the fat stupid fatherhusband and their pretty wives that all seemed to run on ABC for some reason
1,2005 will go down in DrWho history as its most incredible year Everything seemed to click a firstrate new Doctor and companion big audiences  10 million for the first episode and Christmas special  major awards critical acclaim and those idiots who spent years giggling at the Daleks seeming inability to negotiate stairs were well and truly silenced But then Christopher Eccleston dropped a bombshell quitting after just one series It looked like the honeymoon was over Luckily the public appears to have embraced his successor the excellent David Tennant On top of this the show boasts fine SFX like the spaceship crashing into Big Ben in Aliens Of London and superb story lines such as Tooth  Claw Army Of GhostsDoomsday The new DrWho is basically the same as the old only updated for the 21st century Some fans have accused Russell TDavies of ruining the show They need to remember that there was no show for sixteen years until he came along
1,This is an excellent film with an extraordinary cast and acting I was very disappointed with the Academy Awards when this didnt get the Oscar for best film and for best actress Woopi Goldberg it certainly deserved it In any case take a look at it i am sure you will enjoy it very much
1,This movie will not be considered for an academy award but if you enjoy a movie that doesnt take itself seriously and just wants the viewer to enjoy for ninety mins it is not a disappointment Youll enjoy a send up of Darth Vader for the villain the breather a female Batman for the heroine but much cuter with much less costume and a running joke that involves cigarettes and the police captain thats very funny Not by any means a great cinematic achievement But if you enjoy campy fun it was worth a viewing God help me I liked it
0,Having just watched Acacia I find that I have to agree with the negative reviews here I like Asian and Korean horror and I had great expectations for this film Man was i disappointed Watching this I kept thinking surely they just do this to catch me off guard later on and for a while I expected something ingenious to happen However I slowly realised that the film really is that bad It is the cheapest cash in into the Asian horror market I have seen so far  The basic story is perhaps not even that bad but the way it is filmed it seems like the most laughable plot ever The tree as a scary device might be okay if used cleverly but all the filmmaker does is giving us different shots ofyes a tree over and over again He seems to hope that the tree will do all the work for him in terms of tension and buildup but it just feels like what it is shots of a tree For goodness sake Slow buildups can be very effective and a film that presents the viewer with only few glimpses of what is wrong might deliver good scares but not Acacia Sure we get a glimpse of a child on a tricycle disappearing around a corner and yet again meaningful shots of the tree from above or underneath or the side but these scenes are just not scary They feel silly especially because you realise that the director means them to be scary They simply arent  Apart from that I agree with some of the other reviewers that the characters are ridiculous In particular the one characters descent into madness is laughable However what really breaks Acacia is the terrible editing Its hard to see why scenes were cut together the way they are but its bad and it kills any spark of interrest it might have had It also makes me feel patronised because I can see what they are trying to achieve with it but I cannot believe that they think I would fall for such cheap ploys There are lots of great Asian ghost films and lots of bad ones but this is by far the worst I have seen They must have been going through the list of what to put into ghost movies and ticked them all off but in the end they forgot to add the actual movie
1,No message No symbolism No dark undercurrentsJust a wonderful melange of music nostalgia and good fun put together by people who obviously had a great time doing it Its a refreshing antidote to some of the pretentious garbage being ground out by the studios Of course ANYTHING with the incomparable Judi Dench is worth watching And Cleo Laines brilliant jazz singing is a bonus This lady is in the same league as the late Ella This goes on my movie shelf to be pulled out again anytime I feel the need for a warm experience and a hearty good natured chuckle Just a wonderful film
0,This woman never stops talking throughout the movie She memorized every line and delivered all without a bit of natural emotion She also has a most uncharming lisp and the pitch of her voice sounds like nails on a blackboard This film has WAY too much Betsy Drake and not enough Cary Grant who carried what little was left of the film entirely on his own
1,When I heard that this movie was coming out the night before Halloween I was very excited When I found out that it was a book written in 1978 I had to read it before seeing the movie Im sure the movie would have been much different to me if I had not read the book The writers actually did a good job of staying true to the main plot of the book with minor differences naturally I think the thing that disappointed me the most about the movie was Boyle playing the role of Col Im not a big fan of Boyle and it seems that no matter what the mood during the movie shes always trying to use her overplumped lips and darkly makeuped eyes to make herself seem super sexy Indeed I think that the movie held true to the genuine creepiness of the house My favorite subplot was the Sheehan family which is so weird bc the son was killed in Iraq and in current events there is Casey Sheehan whose mother went on a huge antiIraq tirade In the book obviously the war was not Iraq but rather Vietnam and when the house turns on that video of the son in the helicopter I was truly creeped out Overall I was impressed with the movie in that it followed the book very well
0,As Ben Elton once observed nothing goes quicker out of style than comedy Steve Martins latest offering  The Pink Panther 2  recently opened to bad reviews and dismal boxoffice grosses while Mike Myers The Love Guru seems to have won few admirers In 1970 it was Jerry Lewis turn to feel the pain of rejection  ironically his character in this film experiences a funny turn whenever anyone uses that word in his presence  when Which Way To The Front effectively drove him off the big screen for almost a decade In this World War Two comedy he plays Brendan Byers 111 the richest man in the world who wants to join the army to do his patriotic duty  and also because he is bored with being successful  but is rejected as he is medically unfit He then decides to start his own privately funded army recruiting other 4Fs Decked out with ludicrous uniforms that look like those worn by International Rescue in Thunderbirds they go into training Some good visual gags here When they fire rocket launchers they look pleased with themselves until they learn they have just destroyed a Texaco oil station Wishing to learn German Brendan plays a longplaying record called Songs To Mein Kampf By When this army sits down to eat instead of being in a draughty mess hall they are in an opulent room decked out with a chandelier John Wood is very funny as Finkel Byers everso English butler His best scene is when he blackmails a Mafiatype gangster into teaching Byers brigade to kill The script was not by Jerry himself but by Gerald Gardiner and Dee Caruso author of a number of episodes of The Monkees Front often has the look and feel of a television sitcom indeed at times you almost expect to hear a laughtrack Where it goes badly wrong is in the last thirty minutes when Byers replaces a top Nazi commander and after ordering the Germans to withdraw from the front gets involved in the plot to kill Hitler  and Tom Cruise is nowhere in sight  As the commander Jerry delivers a performance of such mindnumbing ineptitude as to defy description He gives Brian Blessed a run for his money in the loudest man alive stakes It comes as a relief when the end credits appear Perhaps the timing was just wrong  bringing out a war comedy when the Vietnam conflict was raging was not a good idea Or the public simply had had enough of Jerry  that beard probably did not help  What he needed here was a good producer someone to take him in hand and say That gag stinks Throw it out Dont Raise The Bridge Lower The River is a masterpiece by comparison with this picture As the 70s got underway the new comedy icons would be Woody Allen Mel Brooks and Monty Python  fresher more biting and in Allens case more human styles of comedy replaced Jerrys brand of slapstick It would not be until 1982 that he would make anything like a successful comeback  as the conceited talkshow host Jerry Langford in Martin Scorceses brilliant The King Of Comedy
1,Anatole Litvak directed the 1959 film The Journey starring Yul Brynner Deborah Kerr Robert Morley EG Marshall Anne Jackson and Jason Robards The film takes place during the 1956 Hungarian uprising and concerns a group of travelers having problems getting out of Budapest because of political problems in that part of the world They are put on a bus to Vienna but the Russians led by Major Surov Brynner confiscate their passports and hold them for questioning One of the passengers is Paul Fleming Robards posing as an American but in reality a Hungarian freedom fighter whom the major believes is being smuggled out of Hungary In fact Lady Ashmore Kerr is hiding him She becomes the focus of the Majors romantic attentions Very good film that conveys the tension and hassle of the Cold War and all of the performances are wonderful Brynner is particularly excellent as the passionate Major who isnt all bad and Anne Jackson gives a realistic powerful performance as a pregnant woman who doesnt want her child born in a Communist country Good script good director good cast  there should be more films like this Highly recommended
0,Theres tons of goodlooking women in this flick But alas this movie is nudityfree Grrrrrrrrrr Strike one Ahem One story in this film takes place in 1971 Then why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage Hello Continuity anyone As you might know this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen Im not sure if someone botched the job on this but there WAS no 3D just doublevision blurs I didnt have the same problem with this companys other 3D movies HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD Sure the 3D in those ones sucked too but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect This thing is a big ball of nothing And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the eareating dame yum Id like to see more of her In movies as well Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr 
1,Im glad I read the Sarah Waters novel first since I had my own pictures of the characters in my head at the time The ones cast for this production however were not at all disappointing  in fact after I got used to Rachael Stirling as Nan I think Nina Gold did a damn fine job in the casting department Can Keeley Hawes be more delicious The BBC has done it again this is a wonderful production of a very good book and they have done it up in style If you can get your hands on this VHS DVD be sure to get the 181minute version the uncensored one It is a marvelous journey albeit a bit rocky at times that you wont regret taking
1,This final entry in George Lucass STAR WARS movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot However this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series On the contrary Sure its not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slowgoing at times but RETURN OF THE JEDI still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission The first third of the movie where Luke and his friends rescue Han from the palace of Jabba the Hutt is a classic Jabba a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language not only makes a great villain but a memorable one too It must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product Actually what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of Jabbas court including the intimidating slavering Rancor and scary Sarlaac pit monster It builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while Things get a little bit slower around the second act where Luke discovers that he and Leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of Endor home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart Ewoks Most of the complaints about RETURN OF THE JEDI that Ive read seem to be centered on these furry creatures in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga I dont totally agree with that although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should However their leader Wicket played by Warrick Davis is a delightfully memorable creation and watching how they handle the Imperial Troops technology with their simple natural weapons provides a nice contrast By the time we get to the third act though the pace picks up again as we intercut between the Ewoks battle against the troops Lando and the Rebel Forces launching an attack against the Empires allnew halfcompleted Death Star and Lukes final showdown with Darth Vader and the Emperor The latter ties with the Jabba Palace sequence as the highlight of the movie Mark Hamill flexes his acting chops once again as Luke Skywalker in these scenes and watching him as a fully matured Jedi Knight makes for an unforgettable performance Also as iconic as James Earl Jones voice as Darth Vader is he is rivaled only by the shriveled cronelike Emperor played with deliciously raspy frightening evil by Ian McDiarmid The tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored The STAR WARS movies have always set standards for special effects and the technical work in RETURN OF THE JEDI can easily hold a candle to its predecessors The space battle fights are as exhilarating as always and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout Of course given that this movie was made after A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK it probably shouldnt be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence The acting is classic STAR WARS fare Hamill Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher all mature and deepen into their roles and Anthony Daniels provides more hilarious moments as C3PO Frank Ozs Yoda only appears in two scenes but he makes the most of it And yes theres also John Williams music All told while RETURN OF THE JEDI falters a little bit in the middle the first and third acts deliver in style making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever In 1997 George Lucas rereleased the classic STAR WARS in digitally restored and revamped Special Editions which featured addedin effects andor shots as well as some enhancements Of the three RETURN OF THE JEDI appears to have caused the most commotion with STAR WARS fans Perhaps it can be due to the jarringly outofplace albeit funny if youre not so easily offended Jedi Rocks musical number in Jabbas Palace which although technically amazing does disrupt the flow of the film However I DID like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy This DVD version features yet more tweakingwe get to see more montage finale scenes notably on Naboo where we hear what sounds like Jar Jar Binks screaming Wesa free and in what is probably the most controversial change Hayden Christensen as the specter of Anakin Skywalker in the closing scenes Probably due to the intense and unfair disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in EPISODE II ATTACK OF THE CLONES it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone However if youre watching the STAR WARS saga chronologically and contemplating about it chances are you may react a little differently Nonetheless it is an issue that fans have raised so its probably best to be warned beforehand As nice as it would be to have Lucas release the original versions of these three classic films he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the definitive editions of his classic trilogy and when viewing the STAR WARS movies altogether as one complete saga as Lucas intended it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent The original films will always be engraved in our memories but these new incarnations are just as much fun if one can give them a chance
1,Has anyone found a way to purchase copies of this series yet I can see that a lot of people have inquired but I cant tell if any of them have been successful Its hard to believe that a series this good cannot be viewed by people today especially one based on real issues faced by real people during what were both tense and exciting times in our country How can this be true and what can we do to change it As an aside I agree with all the comments other writers have made about this series on this web site This is an excellent story about events that everyone should be aware of and know something about today Lots of us saw this series when we were in college or around that time anyway Now we want to share it with our children  but we cant If that is true what would some good written materials be that would relay the same information
0,This is not a boring movie the audience might stay on its chair fascinated by this selfish character Miles Berkowitz both filmmaker and actor here The storyline is simple  after a divorce and ten years of a hollywoodian noncareer the author plays is quest for love in front of the camera The first question is about how true is all that  what is written what came by chance  Both answers yes or no portrays MBerkowitz as a low average human beeing If you look for a selffiction about love like this one I recommand you to read some independant comic books  Chester Brown Joe Matt Beside of this I felt quite disappointed to hear so much against my country France I know american people usually say that the french are arrogant that might be true then etc and for sure the french and the whole world have lots of griefs against america but why so much hate  Dont think I couldnt like this movie only because of that anyhow
0,How bad idea was to remake an almost Oscar worthy film MOSTHLY MARTHA is MUCH MORE BETTER has deepness finesse and so on and mainly a wonderful and talented actress in the leading role Martina Gedeck Its a joke and ugliness with the handsome Aaron and the whole atmosphere again a ridiculous effort from Hollywood There are more and more remake and the films are full with schemes Isnt anybody there who can create a good and newly script Or this is a safety solution to make remake or movies from the welltried cartoon figures The films are getting much less interesting nowadays Oh yes If you want to see a REALLY good movie watch the original one Its definitely worth
0,I am so disappointed After waiting for 3 years for repeatsthe DVD of the original masterpiece series Darkplace i couldnt wait for this series The first episode just ended and I am appalled Everything that was great about Darkplace has been erased here pretty much Worst introduction canned laughter this takes the original point of it away and just renders it nearly unwatchable one joke about Garths eyes fertilizing the audience was good the rest i can hardly remember it feels like a poor quality Knowing Me Knowing You I hope this improves as the series goes on otherwise i shall be seriously disappointed back to Darkplace You are the most compassionate man I ever known And i know God
1,I have to say as a BSG fan I wasnt exactly sure what Id think of this show I saw it on the big screen at the Arclight cinema tonight as part of the Paley Center screenings and the cast and film makers spoke afterwards Ron Moore said they wanted to make a clean break from Battlestar and do something different and that yes they would lose some fans but hopefully theyd gain others  Even without their talk I am now a fan of the new show But heres what I thought of the film I loved it It was really very good I guess Im a true scifi or syfy  do I really have to type that geek because Id totally watch this as a series It has a strong and rich story and kept my interest  It starts with a small group of teenagers plotting something which to me was the weakest part and a bit confusing The actor playing Ben should have given us more of a glimpse into his intense beliefs The actress playing Zoe seemed a little posy but she was playing a teenager and Im sure I wont be the only one who thought Zoe was a cylon at first perils of being a BSG geek If theyre hoping these will be the new BamberHelferPark they may want to rethink it Surprisingly it was the adults that captured the audiences attention Eric Stoltz gives a stellar performance as Daniel Greystone a man so haunted by his family tragedy that he jumps at the first chance of getting out of his grief and doesnt let go He does a chilling and enthralling job of conveying his characters sly knowledge of the inner world of computers and people especially in a scene in which he spins a web for the young teenage friend of his daughters traps her then dismisses and releases her No sign at all of the serial killer he played on Grays Anatomy really impressive acting Equally as strong though not in it nearly as much is Paula Malcomson as his wife Amanda Greystone She is just as smart and well written and beautifully played as Stoltzs part and I completely believed that they are a couple and a couple that have been together forever and have a strong relationship something rarely seen these days I look forward to seeing what happens with this family and hope they give her as much to do as Roslin in BSG she is strong and smart and when she lashes out at her kid you cringe its really great Not to mention her eyes which could hold magical powers thats how intense they are The scene where she takes on the government agent very short scene but beautifully played really gives you an idea of her power The other part of the show that did not work 100 for me were the scenes with Esai Morales and the mafia type clan of his He does a good job overall but I did not believe in this mobs power nor intimidated by their threats I found myself wishing that this whole story line was a bit more mysterious and hard to figure out the way it is presented is almost an homage to the Godfather they kind of hit you over the head with it a bit But given time I can see how this will develop into an interesting Upstairsdownstairs kind of thing with the poor minorities Morales et al versus the rich folk who rule the planet Stolz et al And to be honest I did enjoy it when he spoke to his son about the origin of their name that was a very well played scene Note to BSG fans the boy playing Willy Adama doesnt really look much like Olmos but hes just a kid Whether or not hell be featured any more than he was in this film who knows I sure couldnt tell But it didnt bother me because he wasnt as interesting as everything else going on around him Polly Walker plays Sister Clarice and shes chilling and odd in every scene shes in Im not sure where shell go or who shell end up with but I was very impressed with her acting In this film she was sort of on the side but obviously being set up to play a very important part later on She was nothing like her character in Rome something I always find impressive in actors One nice surprise the music is actually better and less obvious than BSG even though its the same guy doing it Bear McCreary It has a haunting and unusual approach that took me by surprise Id buy this score if I had the chance As to the panel discussion after the show it was hosted by Seth Green Ron Moore was very smart and articulate David Eick was cracking wise much like his video diaries Esai Morales told a long story about how he was cast and Eric Stoltz was very funny and didnt really answer the questions  but Ive always had a thing for him Paula Malcomson was tough she took Seth Green to task for mistakenly saying she was on 24 and the girls who played Zooey and Lacey were both darling Grace Park and Tricia Helfer were there as well answering questions about how they did the scenes acting with themselves on BSG Overall a very interesting and wonderful evening Im giving the show a 9 out of 10 and very much looking forward to watching it all unfold NOTE I just watched this a second time and really hope they explore what the HOLOBAND was originally made for I have no idea what that may be but it holds a great deal of fascination to me
0,An annoying group of exstudents from Monte Alto International High School decide to spend a night in the now abandoned institution where a mystery killer called the watchman played by horror legend Paul Naschy murders them off one by oneSchool Killer features some references to such teen slasher staples like Scream or Friday the 13thThe climatic twist ending looks like lilted from The Sixth SenseThe uncertainty about whether the homicidal watchman is alive or dead provide some mild interestbut the characters are onedimensional and the endless scenes of walking through dark school corridors really got on my nervesThe presence of charismatic Paul Naschy almost saves this clichÃ©d slasher flickThere is also some decent gore on display including a splendidly bloody beheadingIts nice to see Manuela Velasco of Rec fame in a small role4 out of 10
1,I wonder sometimes if maybe Meryl Streep has become so accepted as the most impressive versatile actress since well maybe just about the beginning of the sound era that maybe her talent is now taken for granted There are probably about three tics that she relies on consistently throughout her performances most noticeably a pinched lip but other than that her performances are amazingly variable and original and fresh expressions of internal workings Even though Sophies Choice and A Cry in the Dark and Silkwood may be showier her work here and in Bridges in Madison County is remarkable too  just more subtle In One True Thing she is mostly sweet and in love with her domesticated life and Streep makes what could be routine even boring seem attractive and charming I think that she must work out these minitheses for each character and find what things make this person real and interesting She works from the inside out with each character and maybe its this essential quality that has evoked the main criticism of aloofness or selfconsciousness I dont think shes cold at all but instead has thought out her characters unique qualities I think her critics are confusing selfconsciousness with intelligence Not too many other actors would be so complexly thoughtful and creative as to make Kate Muldrun lightweight and carefree within her beloved homey environment only to later reveal unprecedented depth because of her genuine attachment to that homey environment Her performances are of an unsurpassed consistency she rarely does anything wrong I wonder if its conceivable for any of Streeps pictures to not seem diminished because of her presence Anyway Kate loves her home and her affection for her family life is as endearing as her new conflict within the home is jarring When all of this comes together and Kate starts to recognize that she can no longer function in the same capacity and she breaks the pie dish and screams out that she is not handicapped it is painfully sad to watch because this has not been someone prone to emotion Streep is smart enough and generous enough to recognize how much better everything works because she has felt out the dramatic validity of Kate and its really the only scene when she allows her character to go But how refreshingly true it is to see a character who can really surprise you by displaying something that you wouldnt have thought possible Once again Streeps character has at least three dimensions God this sounds like a thesis itself but as an actress Streep just has a special kind of intelligence incredible empathy and great expressive skills The movie itself is probably somewhat mediocre I suppose William Hurt is meant to be an unlikeable jerk and he does pompousness very well I think Hurt is really kind of creepy though Script is quite standard  another tribute to Streep that she was as touching and believable as she was
0,The only remarkable fact is the participation of Klaus Kinski who plays a priest Dont ask me why he does it A bad bad movie overall 
0,All my friends and various other coworkers think this show is soooo great First I hate this show I think I might be the only female alive I only watched it because my best friend adores it and fancies herself to be the Charlotte character First the whole plot If you can call it that is about four women Superslut Samantha Kim Cattrallwho most likely has every STD available and mossybrown and green genitals considering she is tri sexual shell try anything Samantha is not like most 40 something women even in NY but than the show would not have some kind of entertainment since Samantha along with some good NY scenery is the only reason to watch and those are not reason enough  Charlotte Kristen Davis is a well dressed upper class NY idiot who still believes the Pince Charming myth However sweet and pretty she is do not let that fool you she spreads quite often Miranda Cynthia Nixon now this woman is stereotypical angry butch feminist I think in one episode she is thought to be a lesbian but apparently is notWhat a shame shes almost interesting Carrie Sarah Jessica Parker the most annoying character I swear I thought I was watching Twisted Sister front man Dee Sniders more manly looking cross dressing sissy boy brother This is a girl looking for cant live without you loveHeard of a puppy This show is stupid and I love making fun of it because I hear about how it is some kind of new awakening for women That is just sad if your looking to watch slutty pathetic addictive people in way too expensive clothes drinking cosmopolitans and sounding like an annoying 15 yr old on cocaine than there is a show for youjust use protection
1,I remember this in a similar vein to the Young Ones Wed stumble back from the pub and watch this or tape it and then spend weeks replaying the lines to each other We called one of our mates Zipmole Watkins after the brilliant episode in which Daniel Peacock has a bit of restyling on his nose by the Back Street Abortionist Lots of great lines Remember at 530 in the morning you can only get white bread from a brown man Take it easy guy  Gandhi as a local shopkeeper Tony woodcock was definitely on there in the episode they were teaching Ralph Daniel Peacock to be a barman Its no good Amanda Ill never make it as a bar man Helen Lederer teaches him to ask people about the match See the match last night I thought Woodcock played well After a string of failed conversations the curly haired Arsenal star was sitting at the bar See the match last night Yeah I thought I played well We still do odd stupid lines now  Reg and Ralph or Ralph and Reg Reg Reg Reg Reg Reg Reg Lots of very surreal silly moments and very surreal songs from the Flatlets  The Back Street Abortionist a personal favourite with the great ending line  And hell mark your packages Return To Sender Good old Danny Peacock  you added a lot to some young drinkers evenings sir Update  I found a couple of episodes on tape  Im going to upload the Gandhi sketch to Youtube 
1,This feels as if it is a Czech version of Pearl Harbor It has a same story both guys fall in love with the same woman And add to the twist the woman is actually a married one whose husband has been missing for a year I dont think that the story line is too strong The younger guy is quite naughty that is cute It kept me watching because of the emotional music and the pleasing scenes one after another It also has some strong visual special affects Best of all the love stories is seamlessly integrated with the story  I think that if it was in English it would be such a big shot all across the states It is too bad that not that many people are open for foreign movies
1,I laughed a lot while watching this Its an amusing short with a fun musical act and a lot of wackiness The characters are simple but their simplicity adds to the humor stylization The dialog is funny and often unexpected and from the first line to the last everything just seems to flow wonderfully Theres Max who has apparently led a horrible life And theres Edward who isnt sure what life he wants to lead My favorite character was Tom Edwards insane boss Tom has a short role but a memorable one Highly recommended for anyone who likes silly humor And you can find it online now which is a bonus I am a fan of all of Jasons cartoons and cant wait to see what he comes out with next
0,I readily admit that I watch a lot of really bad movies But there are very few that I can think of that are quite as bad as When Women Had Tails Its a stinker of epic proportions What should have been a sexy comedy about a group of cavemen discovering a woman for the first time is instead a dull lifeless affair without a single laugh to be had The comedy is extremely weak I suppose if you think bashing someone in the head is funny you might find a laugh or two The guys in this movie make the Three Stooges look like high art And theres just not enough of a plot to hold the thing together It seems to drag on and on and on Well you may be asking yourself If its as bad as you say why havent you rated it lower than a 310 Good question And Ive got two answers First the movie is not without its curiosity value I do find a bit of interest in an Italian spoof of movies like One Million Years BC with Raquel Welch Ill give When Women Had Tails a point for its historic value The other two points are for the mere presence of Senta Berger I know its not much of an explanation or reasoning for a rating but what are you going to do Its the best I can come up with
1,I never saw any of John Leguizamos standup before I watched Freak and after seeing it again on HBO comedy recently it was better more enlivening and with things that at the age of 14 I couldnt understand quite before Spike Lee did a wonderful job directing keeping the visual angle up to par with Leguizamos theatrics and the style of personal storytelling its substance and style merging together but unobtrusively We get Leguizamos rants about race and sex the bits about sex are classic but a lot of it is about family and what sticks still fresh in my mind is about his father Even when things get dark in some of the stories theres something fresh or crazy or random that Leguizamo pulls out to get a laugh and it works more often than not If something does fall flat for me at any rate it might be his personality tics here and there But overall its the kind of fun material that isnt heady but is so true to itself that it stings Find it if you can
1,Lots and lots of information to digest and if youve seen Zizek you know his pace Also if you havent seen most of the films or at least some other films by the same directors mentioned in this doc you will be somewhat lost  And the film list is long Director includes Hitchcock Psycho Vertigo Birds Lynch Lost HighwayMullholland Falls Wild at Heart Blue Velvet  Tarkovsky Stalker Solaris and The ConversationCoppola  There are some segway films like Star Wars Espisode III Matrix  but these I suspect are baits To be sure Zizek is never boring but if you dont buy or if you mind the psycho analytics then youll be annoyed to no end  But you should not be as the setting clips the way the film interleave with these clips Zizeks points are never boring
1,Malcolm McDowell diagnoses Megan Gallaghers daughter and she as having a form of illness when they believe they are seeing The Huldre trolllike creatures which live with the rocks and the roots to quote the movie Basically a family moves into an older house which has a smaller dollhouse in the backyard The daughter well played by Sofia Vassiliova starts to befriend the creatures until they become vindictive The family cat also disappears There are a few good scenes with Megan Gallagher Millennium and Malcolm McDowell as the psychiatrist There is also something strange which occurred to one of McDowells patients If you enjoy this type of story you may also like Bad Ronald which had a similar odd theme and the house is haunted by bad Ronald Scott Jacoby only that movie is from the 70s 710
0,This is a silly spoof of private eye thrillers as a novelistMichael Cainis called upon to ghostwrite an autobiography of a colorful waning Hollywood starMickey Rooney At times silliness becomes obnoxious This is not Cain at his best Rooney is way over the top Notable support from Lizabeth Scott Lionel Stander and the comely Nadia Cassini Not easy to watch
1,This film is full of charming situations and healthy young people easy on the eyes whether they are wearing clothes or not The strong superstructure of its plot is upheld by the art of Shakespeare As Joseph Papp discovered back in the 1950s in Central Park Shakespeares plots can be adapted to the manners and customs of the present And so the classic tales of crossdressing and other mischief found in such lighthearted comedies such as Twelfth Night and A Midsummer Nights Eve and As You Like It are used to good effect in this film All the young actors and actresses do a good job of advancing the plot with their blocking and dialog and costumes And the idea of a soccer game to bring things to a climax reminds me of Bend It Like Beckham another charming coming of age movie
1,What Alice Found is the greatest movie that nobodys ever heard of I underestimated it when I heard of it and I though that it would all sex no plot and just really stupid but in reality it was really good They say all indie movies suck but this one and Napoleon Dynamite didnt suck I asked my friend whod seen it before I did and she said that Alice has all these threeways and you see all this nudity but no there is no threeway that I remember and little nudity The movie did have a point and it taught me never trust hitchhikers I liked that in the end they got Alice a little dolphin In the end on her way to Flordia I totally suggest seeing this movie
1,DONT TORTURE A DUCKLING is one of Fulcis earlier and honestly in terms of storyline better films  and although not the typical bloodbath that Fulci is known for  this is still a very unique and enjoyable film The story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring Some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations  either as suspects or those helping the investigation or in some cases both  include the towns police force a smalltime reporter a beautiful and rich exdrug addict a young priest and his mother An old man who practices witchcraft and his female protÃ©gÃ© a mentally handicapped townsman and a deafmute little girl All of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns until the actual killer is revealed DONT TORTURE A DUCKLING is neither a classical giallo or a typical Fulci gore film Although it does contain elements of both  it is more of an oldfashioned murder mystery with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence although nothing nearly as strong as some of Fulcis later works This is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end Recommended for giallomurdermystery fans or anyone looking to check out some of Fulcis nonsplatter films  but dont despair DONT TORTURE still has more than its fair share of violence and sleaze Some may be put off by the subject of the child killings and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys which is also kind of disconcerting  but if that type of material doesnt bother you then definitely give this one a look 8510
1,Everyone likes the coolly created memorable heist movie Alain Delon provides the antihero Melville provides the cool and a handful of other great talent Yves Montand Gian Maria Volonte and Andre Bourvil mostly arrives to add a crisp engaging movie with very little dialog This is great because one certain aspect of the genre tends to be a lot of dialog involving the quickwitted and their various repartees This movie however could be watched with the sound completely off and not too terribly much would be missed Not to say the sound is bad oh no the jazzy soundtrack and the crisp audio catching the little movements makes the slow patient deliberation of the patients very compelling Whats also really neat about this film is that the color cinematography is pretty fantastic Usually when it comes to cinematography black and white movies tend to stick out in my mind but this film has some very strong and beautiful imagery that makes the movie pure visual pleasure to observe PolarisDiB
0,Twenty years ago the five years old boy Michael Hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later On the present days Michael Gordon Currie invites his girlfriend Peg Stacy Grant and his best friends Chris Myc Agnew Jennifer Emmanuelle Vaugier Lisa Ann Kelly Benson Ned Brendon Beiser Mitch Maldive Phillip Rhys and Trish Rachel Hayward to spend the Halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm He asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear and together with his Indian friend Crow Byron Chief Moon they would perform an ancient Indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy Morty Jon Fedele that would eliminate their fears forever The greatest fear of Michael is to become a serial killer like his father but something goes wrong and Morty turns into his father killing his friends The Fear Resurrection is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows but in a messy screenplay full of clichÃ©s There are some exaggerated performances like for example Ms Betsy Palmer others very weak but in general the acting is good Unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live further in spite of being surrounded by close friends the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies The lowpace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation In the very end Michael shows a charm that his father was interested that I have not noticed along the story I do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the DVD released in Brazil with 87 minutes running time The special effects are very reasonable for a Bmovie My vote is four Title Brazil Fear 2 Uma Noite de Halloween Fear 2 One Night of Halloween
1,Forget the jaded comments that come before these This is an action packed but sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting Wellacted even by Elizabeth Berkley Recommended for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change
1,The Best of Everything is a high gloss large screen soap opera which follows the careers of four career women Hope Lange Suzy Parker Diane Baker and Martha Hyer at a New York publishing firm Whats the best for some women is not necessarily the best for all Presiding over this group of young fillies is wise old mare Joan Crawford whos been around the track a few times on screen and in real life She looks right at home as the boss lady as well she should have at this point Around the time she was making The Best of Everything Joan Crawford became a widow when her fourth husband Alfred Steele died It was a particularly traumatic event for her she woke up one morning and found him dead in bed next to her She inherited all of his stock in Pepsi Cola where he was the board chairman and during the same period as The Best of Everything was being made she wound up the queen bee at Pepsi Cola Life does sometimes imitate art So that authority as she barks out dictation and coffee orders to Hope Lange rings real true In fact all the women here with the exception of Lange are in for some rough sledding Its rough for Lange too but she literally makes the best of everything What a collection of stinkers the men are in this film The best of them Stephen Boyd is a heavy drinker The others Louis Jourdan Robert Evans and Brett Halsey are as slimy a collection of rodents as ever gathered for one film I cant forget Brian Aherne either whos the fanny pinching head of this publishing firm Half that office would have sexual harassment suits going today Some nice location shots of New York in the fifties make the film a real treat Catch it by all means
1,I have found this movie available for streaming on Netflix and thought Id give it a try The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor Colm Feore and David Cubitt who have finally seen each other after their father has passed away Ryan and Theo at first argue about who did what But later Theo finds out that his brother Ryan is not only gay but he is dying of a terminal illness So Ryan and Theo spend their time patching up their differences This is such an incredible film I have only seen Colm Feore in Season 7 of 24 but he was phenomenal in this David Cubitt an actor I have NEVER heard of before did a phenomenal job as well I would recommend this to those who are interested in the Gay and Lesbian genre This is one movie you dont want to miss I give this film 10 stars out of 10 Excellent film
1,Though the video technology may be dated this classic musical play now on DVD is the best version of Sondheims most important and polished work on Broadway If youve never seen SWEENEY TODD then you must buy this DVD I saw this production in November 1980 at Kennedy Center in Washingtonand fell in love with a preMurder She Wrote Angela Lansbury Subsequently I tried to find any and all of her work among them MOVIES The Harvey Girls The Picture of Dorian Gray Manchurian Candidate CDs Mame Dear World and Gypsy and many more The rest of the cast is flawless too All in all this wonderful DVD gives us the definitive version of Sondheims opera
1,Sometimes realism can work against the effectiveness of a film Thats no problem here The sets are cheesy inside and out The fog is ubiquitous half disguising the shabbiness of the production If theres a bar the name painted on the front window says simply Wine And Spirits The result is a claustrophobic set of scenes Not a single shot of a city or even a fake skyline Thats the kind of Dublin this story is about just as Jack the Ripper movies are about seedy foggy cobblestoned Whitechapel Who would want it any other way How could it have been any other way with no bankable stars a minuscule budget and a fourweek shooting schedule The acting follows suit  outrageously hammy on everyones part Sometimes my God its positively excruciating Mrs McPhillips moaning after Frankie is shot dead outside the house Victor McLaglin however delivers exactly the right kind of overdone performance Wardrobe has stuffed him into a toosmall jacket so that he seems to be bursting out of it like Frankensteins monster His every movement seems to go a little farther than it was intended to When he slaps his cap on his head he bops himself on the temple A big blustering blubbering baby he seems constantly drunk He betrays his best friend for the reward money which will take him and his wouldbe girl to America not a good guy in the ordinary sense Yet we wince as he begins to spend the 20 pounds more and more of it during a wild alcoholic night because every expensive and grandiose gesture takes him farther from his dream I wouldnt argue it but I can understand why he won an Oscar As for Max Steiners score wow Every movement already overdone is not only underlined by the Mickey Mouse music but highlighted in glossy yellow It shouldnt have happened  the heavenly choirs the endearing young charms the minstrel boy the gurgling tune while McLaglen drinks from the bottle It would have been better off with no score at all Well how is it as a whole Dated  by any measure but not a product of its times Thats why I admire it Yes the symbolism is clumsy at times McLaglen a real dummy bumping his head against a hanging sign The fog The blind man But what impresses me is how little of this was being tried at the time What strikes us as overly arty today was in 1936 something quite different from what was seen in most of the programmers being ground out at the time If it falls short at times it doesnt matter The movie was an act of courage politically and morally as well as poetically The legion of decency condemned it because of a scene in a brothel A directors goal should exceed his grasp or whats a script for Watching it now however in 2006 the story is more disturbing than ever John Ford obviously sympathized with the Irish rebels They kill but only out of what they see as necessity He knows too much to live What if he goes to the Tans Oh its not meself Im thinking of but all of us of Ireland herself The Irish are sentimentalized and sympathetic I wonder if the Jihadists in the Middle East dont use a similar logic to justify their acts of violence
1,I saw it last night and I was laughing out loud for the whole second half of the movie The whole audience was Bruce Campbell has made a damn funny movie I dont want to give anything away but when the film turns and gets wacky it gets really wacky Just one funny scene after another My hats of to Mr Campbell and crew for pulling this off on such a tiny budget Bruce was there to introduce the film and do a Q and A which was a treat A lot of the questions people were asking were pretty lame but Bruce would turn it around on them and be all sarcastic He was great Anyway loved the film Ill be looking forward to seeing this on DVD later this year B sure to check it out on the SciFi channel this fall I highly recommend this one
0,This movie was included in the Six Wives of Henry VIII BBC miniseries DVD I loved those six movies They were wellacted wellscripted and historically accurate I did actually read Gregorys book and liked it well enough despite its HUGE historical inaccuracies I mean the whole fake homosexual angle with George Boleyn in particular but this movie didnt even mention that That angle was one of the pivotal points of the book  Above all this movie just leaves me asking WHY Why do we see as someone else aptly put The Real World Tudor England Why are the camera angles so bad in general  Why is the script so bad I mean I know it was improv but come on The actors at time stutter and stammer over their lines and its obvious that theyre making them up as they go along Why are the sex scenes so awkward The way they were done in the book made them at least somewhat interesting In the movie theyre just bad verging on being absolutely hilarious At one point the actress playing Mary Boleyn was having sex with the actor playing Henry VIII Hes thrusting away and shes got this look on her face that says HmI need to go to the store Is he done yet Maybe if he finishes I can go pick up some cheese real quick Its just bad Why does Catherine of Aragon play such a small role in this movie Her refusal to get a divorce was one of the leading causes for the scandal that rocked Christiandom Shes the reason why Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn couldnt get immediately married Why is she not present here Over all this movie is just bad
1,Drum scene is wild Cook Jr is unsung hero of this and many movies Fantastic actor great flick A few twists that keep you moving A mustsee
1,  but it was on a UHF channel and the reception was very fuzzy Id really like to own the movie since the reason I watched it in the first place is because I am a bus driver and at the time I saw this movie I was driving that model bus It was only during his murder trial some 15 years later that I remember vaguely that OJ was one of the stars in it I only recall that he was the driver and of the bus being shot up and driven wildly Ive been looking all over for this movie to no avail since viewing it in the mid80s I liked the movie I dont usually watch thrillers but after reading the summary in the TV guide and viewing its beginning although fuzzy I stayed for the whole thing
0,This film has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I have ever seen It is about as fun as doing hard manual labor with stomach cramps The movie starts out bad I would rate the first few minutes of the film a 110 and then it get progressively worse minute by minute The only way to rate it at all would be some kind of abyssmal spiraling negative number that grows for ninety long minutes Unfunny is not a real word but it best describes the humor in this video Somehow the video manages even to make cute scantily clad females and sex look grotesque and distasteful This movie is amazingly bad I would say it would be better to be locked up with the TITANIC theme playing over and over and with Buscemis character from ESCAPE FROM LA droning on in your ear than to watch this movie The sequels are not nearly as bad If you have to rent a Troma film get Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock I would rather watch 5 Tony Little infomercials back to back than to see CLASS of NUKEM HIGH again Dont get me wrong it took some kind of criminal genius to make a movie this terrible and if ever a movie deserved an award for being awful this is it
0,Maybe the target audience of this Disney Channel TVmovie will be pleased with it but if any parents are watching along with the youngsters they will clearly see that cranked out is written all over this production Obviously it was no ones dream to make this movie but rather this was concocted in a board room somewhere then produced with cold efficiency There is some talent among the cast but actors like Dabney Coleman and Jay Thomas dont get much of a chance to showcase their talent The impossibly cute Elisabeth Harnois is engaging as the First Daughter but Will Friedle is stuck once again playing another dumb character though hes not nearly as moronic and annoying as in his Boy Meets World role The background for this movie is Washington DC and the White House but there is no real presidential feel to the film and the Secret Service is made out to be little better than the Keystone Kops when it come to doing their duty The Disney Channel presents a lot of original TVmovies and most of them are better than this
1,I avoided this film as a boy because I thought it would be boringÂ…no fights or shooting cops robbers cowboys or Indians It was definitely not a cool film to like So I didnt see TRC until I was in my twenties and found it one of the most beautiful captivating films I have seen All the actors deliver the characterisations perfectly and each emotion is drawn from the viewer scene by scene The filming and direction are deceptively simple but feel so natural and drew me completely into the story My two favourite scenes are Bobbies birthday party and the scene on the station platform near the end directed and edited to perfection The quality and phrasing of Jenny Agutters voice when she calls Daddy My Daddy wrenches emotion from the viewer Tears are welling in my eyes as I think of it This adaptation isnt just a movie it is a piece of precious art as well as being the perfect example of what all film makers should be striving to achieveÂ…creation of an emotional experience
0,For such a great classic tale the setting location Grendel was disappointing As a writer I blame the script which completely lacked dramatic tension The rubric of the club story is useful and would have provided a new take on the literary classic For some weird reason that rubric was dropped early on To know this was shot in 21 days says to me rushed and it unfortunately shows Now well have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen I word on FX I can tolerate really crappy CGI but the script has to rock and this one was just too slow spartan and lacking in drama Id blame it on the actors but since I know writing more than acting Ill pick on my colleague
1,Whats with all the negative comments After having seen this film for the first time tonight I can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely persons day When I saw that Drew Ben Affleck might end up spending the holidays alone I wanted to cry Youll have to see the movie if you want to know why Also even though I liked Tom James Gandolfini and Alicia Christina Applegate after awhile if you ask me they were real snobs However this film did make me smile and feel good inside Before I wrap this up Id like to say that Mike Mitchell has scored a pure holiday hit Now in conclusion I highly recommend this good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely persons day to any Ben Affleck or Christina Applegate fan who hasnt seen it
1,You cannot be seeing the same movie if you didnt grow up in France or spent at least 10 years there like me I dont know if it will ever make it outside French cultural borders I include Belgium and Luxembourg here You cannot translate its kind of fun  every name is joke how many people outside Paris would understand the pun in Couloirdebus the name of one of the Roman legionnaires  However Monica Bellucci is so beautiful I almost forgot to breathe when I saw her
0,This is a new approach to comedy It isnt funny The joke is that this in and of itself is supposed to be funny The story is based on a French short story located in Paris and the characters have French names Louis Aubinard for example  played by  Bob Hoskins The movie also stars the equally French Jeff Goldblum and Natasha Richardson The situations are similar to and the characters perform as if in those CarryOn movies from years back I believe these are also jokes  to cast these actors who make no attempt to act French in any way to have them cavort in the manner of broad English dance hall comedy and to leave the whole bloomin mystery unexplained to the audience In the humour department this is practically the Algonquin Round Table isnt it The movie tries to be charming and quirky and I guess these characteristics are sort of funny Not as funny as Duck Soup or Love and Death perhaps but funnier than The Deer Hunter or The Battleship Potemkin It is an example of personal filmmaking It makes no real effort to reach out and share with the audience but stays true to its premise and its internal logic Although all the situations are unbelievable they are logical within the films own bizarro world I generally like this kind of eccentric movie but I found this one to be paced too slowly to be dullwitted tedious and to provide too few pleasurable surprises or genuine wit It just kind of meanders in predictable and sophomoric ways and wastes some wonderful talents along the way It has to be the low point in the career of each of the major stars who are all otherwise distinguished players I found it to be the biggest waste of talent since The Betsy and I wish I had never seen Goldblum and Hoskins in this thing So call it an interesting miss and pass on it as a rental unless you really have a lot of time to kill 
1,I saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart No other story had such a unfinished ending I grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favourites because it was so unusual  a story about unfairness and cruelty and loneliness and life and choices that cant be undone and the need for others Chirin is made alone when the Wolf kills his mother but the Wolf is alone too when Chirin follows him into the mountain The Wolf doesnt kill the lamb even though each night he says maybe Ill eat you tomorrow The tape of it I have is broken and degraded from age and use I will repair it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as I did as a child Stories like this with this depth and feeling and this intricacy of meaning are very rare It is a sad story but Ive never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made I am glad I have seen this movie and Im glad I saw it as a child
0,I read somewhere where this film was supposed to be a remake of the 1949 film noir Criss Cross I found the latter to be disappointing but it was still better than this film  This movie is a neonoir since its modernday and its in color two things that purists would make it be disqualified for film noir status  The biggest negative to it however wasnt the cinematography that was fine but the muddled storyline Hey some of 40s Dashiell Hammett stories were similar but I didnt care for some of those either The filmmakers here did not help the situation by placing flashbacks into the story what seemed like every three minutes No wonder it was the keep up with this story It was ridiculous What happens is that by the 45minute mark their is so much confusion nobody cares anymore I know I didnt
0,I saw this movie thinking that it would be one of those old B movies that are fun to watch I was so wrong This movie was boring and obviously aimed at males who like looking at corpulent women The story was so ridiculous and implausible that it lost my interest altogether It seemed to be in the same genre as the Ed Wood films  bottom of the barrel
1,amazing movie I saw this movie for the first time on a flight and could not believe that I had not even heard of it before getting on that plane while it may seem at first to be a chick flick it is a film that everyone should see and will enjoy Men watch this movie with someone you love You will enjoy it as much as she does and it will score you big points
1,This Don SiegelClint Eastwood strange and hypnotic drama was left by the wayside in 1971 and what a pity A fascinating character study with some great women for Squint to deal with Geraldine Page was one of our supreme actresses and shes perfectly cast Young Jo Ann Harris is a flirty minx and Elizabeth Hartman who died too young is undeniably repressed A 7 out of 10 Best performance  C Eastwood Released the same year as DIRTY HARRY this did no business beside getting some good reviews Seek this out unless youre only into Explosion films Very subtle and frightening this piece will stick with you
1,After visiting the Kimbell museum in ForthWorth Texas USA enjoying the art and the architecture also of the adjacent Modern Art Museum and having a delightful conversation with the knowledgeable bookstore lady I purchased this a propos DVD with rather high expectationsÂ… and was not disappointed in the least The thematic approach dramatic tension revealing interviews archival footage and stunning architecture are also mixed in a coherent whole to explore the life of the late iconic Louis I Khan The documentary begins contemplative classical music plays archives are scanned with a reflective shadowy face superimposed blurring letters symbolically referencing a train window passing a backdrop landscape Â— a journey Â— focus and out of focus the search eventually culminates to an article in a newspaper Nathanial Khan reads from the front page of the New York Times where his father is simultaneously praised as the best American architect alive and his death announced  When I first read that obituary I have to admit I was looking for my own name I was his child too his only son I didnt know my father very well He never married my mother and he never lived with us Â… He died when I was eleven So years later this illegitimate son is still haunted by unclear fragmented thoughts and feelings about his father who seems to be a great professional and public figure but whos secretive personal life escapes him and affects him to the point where he intends to do something about it For years I struggled to be satisfied with the little pieces of my fathers life Ive been allowed to see but it wasnt enough I needed to know him I needed to find out who he really was So I set out on a journey to see his buildings and to find whatever there was left of him out there It would take me to the other side of the world looking for the man who left me with so many questions So the documentary is twofold by a slow systematic discovery of the worldrenown architect we get to know 1 his ideas buildings and the architectural perspective and 2 his families coworkers peoples life he affected and the human perspective The DVD also offers added insight with a QA with the writerdirector and additional footage that includes such great Louis I Khan quotes as Everything that everybody says is the truth Its their truth It might not be factual and A good idea that doesnt happen is no idea at all This movie is a journey of discovery Selfdiscovery and discovery of a man a great man yet a human imperfect like all of us We get to know him through the eyes of an admiring and slightly bitter son but with the openness and objectivity to really explore without making easy conclusions and without judging By key interviews with people who interacted with him in various capacity We slowly put some pieces together until that final interview with this man from Bangladesh who really seems to bring it back home with visceral and sensible comments Brilliant architect brilliant documentary
0,This could have been the gay counterpart to Gone With The Wind given its epic lenght but instead it satisfied itself by being a huge chain of empty episodes in which absolutely nothing occurs The characters are unidimensional and have no other development in the story theres actually no story either than looking for each other and kissing Its a shame that an interesting aesthetic proposition like having almost no dialog is completely wasted in a film than makes no effort in examining the psychology of its characters with some dignity and achieving true emotional resonance On top of that it pretends to be an art film by using the worst naive clichÃ©s of the cinematic snobbery But anyway if someone can identify with its heavy banality I guess thats fine
0,This movie features two of my favorite actors in Kilmer and Downey It also boasts the always enjoyable Larry Miller in a toosmall part Despite this I found it to be nearly unwatchable Michelle Monaghan may be pretty but she is nearly charisma free and the reasons for Downeys characters obsession with her character is not at all understandable in terms of the information the film presents or the way its portrayed The ending seems pretentious and though the intention seems to be that the audience should join in the nod and wink the film having failed to bring us in on the side of its protagonists leaves us unwilling or unable to do so Fans of the film say that those who disagree simply dont get it I dont think this is so The plot was not complicated or beyond understanding It was simply uninvolving and clumsily and obviously manufactured I got it I just didnt like it Paddy Breathnachs I Went Down and Guy Ritchies Snatch and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels are much better realized examples of the kind of filmmaking that director Shane Black fails to achieve I share a birthday with Shane Black but a look at his credits mostly as a screenwritermakes me want to dissociate myself from any other connection
0,Even 20 years later Ninja Mission stands out as the worst movie I ever managed to sit through Scandanavian ninjas silently enter a scene fire their obnoxiously noisy submachine guns with wild abandon and then silently leave Wow how will we find those silent invisible assassins Just follow the shell casings and smokePainfully bad dialog or was it brilliant and just poorly translated not an Asian in sight in the cast and a whopping total of 3 Asians among the stunt crew The plot is ridiculous the acting pretty much nonexistent  then again ninja cant act Save yourselves  avoid watching at all costs
1,This is the best version of Gypsy that has been filmedBette Midler is simply superb as Mama RoseShe has the voicethe gesturesthe lookand most of alla supreme acting ability to carry the role off and to make her character come aliveHer singing issimply putMAGNIFICENT She especially shines in two numbersEverythings Coming Up Roses and Roses Turn The other actors are also fineparticularly Christine Ebersoll as TessieAlso good is Peter Riegerthis portrayal of Herbie is acted with great style and believabilityThe direction of this movie is veryvery goodThere isnt a false note or gaffe in the entire productionThis film is a vast improvement over the Roz Russell version filmed in 1962Since viewing it againI can state that the three greatest Mama Roses areEthel MermanBette Midlerand Angela Lansbury See this movieYoull be glad that you did
0,I cannot believe this woodenly written and directed piece of cliche film got made There are about four good looking shots the director should think about switching to still photography and thats it A strong cast is utterly wasted scenes repeatedly end at the least interesting moments and the script says nothing new Please spare yourself this movie
0,Although this movie has a slow dreamlike almost mesmerizing pace and an interesting though possibly not entirely accurate description of a rural French constabularys criminal investigation practices and personnel I find it ultimately impossible to recommend I think this movie is simply a setup piece to advance one persons  the directors one presumes  disgust with heterosexuality Certainly human sexuality in all its forms can have their revolting moments no denying that But to choose the bad uniformly at the expense of the good as this film does at every turn suggests a warped sensibility at work In short if you enjoy watching homoeroticism masquerading as compassion and the depiction of heterosexual lovemaking and the female form in a hideous and degrading light  then this movie is for you I dont  and it wasnt
1,Not high art not even exceptionally innovative but a thoroughly enjoyable movie Funny fresh intelligent  there are still people out there who dont need millions of dollars to hide that theyre out of ideas When you compare this to your average Hollywood action flick youre comparing a homemade meal with a big mac
0,Excellent example of the disaster that happens when you combine a challenging script with two actors chosen for physical appeal It is rare for me to be consciously aware of the acting during the first viewing of a movie because I try to just go with the story and save the analysis for the second viewing In the case of Full Ride the acting was so weak that the movie was impossible to appreciate as a story I was too busy during first and only viewing alternating between laughter and nausea Fortunately for most individual members of the cast pretty much everyone in the ensemble is weak the individual talent limitations do not contrast with any actual competent acting Riley Smith and Meredith Monroe are at least well matched physically finding common ground in looking far too old for the credible age of their characters Unfortunately the script requires especially intense and convincing performances to portray their characters which just exposes Smith and Monroes staggering lack of talent On the positive side they know enough to not look directly into the camera and they do not stutter Better to have used a less attractive pair who could physically pass for the proper age The basic story is not particularly original just another variation on An Officer and a Gentleman but it would have provided a nice showcase for a talented pair of teenage actors Then again what do I know Im just a child
0,My husband wanted to watch this film because the review in the paper said that it was better than Fatal Attraction Well not liking either Michael Douglas or Glenn Close I would have to agree Not for conventional reasons though This is one of those films that needs to be watched late at night when you dont want to watch something that really requires thought but dont want to go to bed yet Yancy Butler is a really enjoyable badguy She is not the best of actresses in fact she isnt even good but she is perfect for this role in this film Everyone else in it varies from pine to oak including the slightly disturbing boy who comes across as a warped Pinocchio SPOILER The ending goes a step or two too far complete with the clichÃ© not quite dead up with a roar still gonna get you moment and then theres a shot of Pinocchio with his frozen wooden smirk which makes you wonder if they were going for chilling or just forgot there was botox in the makeup Regardless its a hilarious eighty odd minutes and despite being a bad film you would have to be lacking the humour gene to not enjoy it somewhat Dont pay for it but if youre in that kind of apathetic telly mood then this is just right
0,I think this was a HORRIBLE mistake on Disneys part First off Kuzco does NOT need to pass emperor school to become emperor Thats never happened before Secondly the new voices dont sound like the originals at all Very poor redo And while I adored the movie The Emperors New Groove the New School is just stupid Like all the jokes are the same and many are from the movie The plot gets redundant always Yzma is that how you spell it trying to become empress Kuzco stopping her etc Or Kuzco learning to become a better person I think Kuzco gets annoying with his constant complaints and questions He is a spoiled brat and it bothers me I do not think this is worth five minutes of your time much less a half hour
0,This is just Art house rubbish I sat watching this trash with my Bosnian Friends they found it as boring as i did For a more interesting and more true account watch the excellent movie Saviour This is just a snoozefest with people talking in coffee shopsA cure for insomnia 1 out of 10
1,Cover Girl is the best musical Rita Hayworth ever made Ms Hayworth will always be remembered for Gilda however the next movie would be Cover Girl The story is great It is about a dancer who wants to be a cover girl and makes it big in show business She does it without the help of her talented dancerdirector boyfriend Gene Kelly Mr Kelly is given the chance to choreograph the musical numbers The dances are spectacular It is fun to see Phil Silvers a comic do the musical numbers with Ms Hayworth and Mr Kelly  The supporting cast is perfect Lee Bowman is given a chance to be an interesting third wheel the other boyfriend
0,Start of with the good bit several times Swayze talks Zulu to his friends or that language is heard among the tribes Thats a great plus as normally USA  UK movie audiences think all people on this planet speak English just in case youre one of them no they dont But the acting is tenenkrommend as we say in The Netherlands it makes your toes curl and not in a good way I like Swayze but in this hes awful The muscles in his jaws make overtime and hes frowning the whole movie some one must have told him it looks butch No Patrick it looks silly and is compensation for lack of character Alison Doody Elizabeth has opted for a style of acting that does not meet the style of her coworkers Her acting is sÃ³ relaxed that this movie could have been set in the current days And its not Your frock was a clue Alison The best acting came from the people from the African Continent and Sided Onyulo as Umbopa I liked best Clear warm and in character his performance is a joy to watch  General it is mwahentertaining on a rainy day Pity Could have been better Sack the director
1,This movie probably never made a blip on the radar screen but its got quite a bit of quality Its pretty lifelike yet you think Its only a movie Duvall and Close portray common people and youd never even realize they are now bigname actors It seems that the jerk in this story is a little too old to be chasing Eugenes girlfriend but I guess its possible It seems unlikely that the kid would travel from Montana to Nevada by himself but I guess its possible You might think that the family troubles in this movie would never happen in your own family but I guess its possible I remember Glenn Close saying something like You think the work you do is the hardest part of your life but it isnt
1,Watched this on KQED with Frank Baxter commenting as I recall Have never seen it since but would like to find out where it is available It is amazing how good something can be but be in black and white and have zero special effects In fact amazing how much BETTER something like that is
0,Some slack might be cut this movie due to the fact that it was made in 1979 That much said it really is pretty dire Never mind the laughable backprojection or the awful awful cameratracking of supposed inflight objects its the stunts that the Concorde pulls off that will have you blinking in disbelief at the absurdity Barrelrolls looptheloops and violent evasive maneuvers left me wondering why the AirForces of the world didnt just fly Concordes as their main fighters So here are the important lessons I learned from this celluloid cheesefest  1 The Concorde is at least as agile as a Phantom 4 jetfighter 2 You can fire a flare gun at Mach 2 simply by opening the cockpit window and sticking your arm out 3 If the flare gun fails to discharge do not drop it as it may then go off 4 The Concorde can dodge up to two Sidewinder missiles fired at it at once 5 A flare will distract a heatseeking missile every time 6 Switching off your jetengines is a surefire way of throwing heatseeking missiles off track if 5 above fails 7 When performing a crashlanding in the Concorde it is apparently impossible to jettison your fuel beforehand 8 Concorde pilots are all combattrained veterans As you might imagine this film is not very realistic The effects are primitive by todays standards and that coupled with the nonsense acrobatics the Concorde performs makes this a movie deserving of little but scorn Not recommended Not recommended at all
0,Italians moviemakers love to rip off American movies All of our movies and as often as possible  Im not stating that as a slur against Italy as a whole but I would like to further observe that the Italian film industry does itself great harm by allowing travesties like this to go overseas to be seen by the world at large Thats all Im saying And no more grave injury do the Italian people subject themselves to than by not sticking a harsh penalty upon those who made the world watch Shark rosso nelloceano  which is admittedly a ripoff of the farsuperior Jaws as if you didnt know Lets dive into the plot Get it Hawhaw this huge monstrous swimming thing that looks like a cross between an octopus a shark and Steven Tyler attacks many innocent Americans ie Italians off the coast of Florida ie Italy and the intrepid beerswilling Peter Sopkiw sails out with his anorexic beerswilling girlfriend and other beerswilling people whose main purposes are to be eaten by the creature killed by mysterious forces who want the creature left alone or just stand around and be otherwise useless and swill beeror be the doctor in this film who defibrilates dying patients repeatedly 20 maybe 30 times in a row without waiting for his paddles to recharge must be one heck of a good battery there doc Then theres the monsterbrother if you thought the Jaws shark was fake look herein and have your mind changed IMMEDIATELY This is a movie that was directed as an afterthought by a Bava edited with an onion chopper acted by ambulatory beerswilling pieces of driftwood and written by PRESUMABLY beerswilling people who should never ever ever ever be let near a typewriter movie studio or major city in the world ever again If this is how the people who made this film think real people act in such a situation theyve obviously made one too many of them zombie movies Or swilled too much beer Need I say this movie is bad It is bad like green cottage cheese bad like a Hawaiian shirt at a formal wedding bad like the Bad Theatre skits Dan Aykroyd used to host on Saturday Night Live bad like Calista Flockhart Weight Gain Tablets  get it Good Mike and the SOL gang slap this beerdrunk beauty upside the head repeatedly and reveal this horror film as what it is horrible Though with a certain European charm its charming when watched by a European  preferably a beerswilling one No stars for the waterlogged dead fish known as Shark rosso nelloceano six stars for the MST3K version and now anyone for a beer 
0,The film is annoying Technically there are too many times you see unfocused and very roughly edited scenes One could easily get a cleaner film using a decent amateur camera and 100 video editing software Down to earth man on the street doesnt mean sloppy editing Unfocused scenes that dont contain important statement should have been deleted The same goes for making sure that the objects headhandothers stay in the frame My 8 years old son knows that by now The film is way too long The main point anti globalization is understood after 30 minutes why bother with all the rest After the interview with James Suckling I pressed the stop button What a waist of time The main theme just doesnt work for me anymore Ive seen too many small wineries which produce mediocre commercialized wines and many big wineries that produce great and unique wines The movie identifies the small producers as the ones that are producing wines with more Identity or terroir The bigger ones are accused of producing internationalized or commercialized wines The film is trying to make a black and white statement in a world full of gray tones However the movie hasnt proved this claim They look at a couple of sporadic examples tie some of the big producers Frescobaldi with fascism and provided interviews with key people Well did all the small producers spent WWII in the resistance Is it relevant to see that Parker has a thing with Bulldogs The movie is very manipulative and unconvincing
0,This film is really really bad it is not very well done and is a lack lustre attempt at something but I am not sure what I watched it and was very disappointed It promised a lot but delivered nothing at all The characters are shallow and wooden and the music if you can call it that is dreadful There are of course all the creatures and animated beings but they are so poorly done that it does not come across as anything other than a third rate movie It is a real shame that more attention could not have been spent to the special effects not the be all and end all of a movie I agree but in a movie that is based around them its a very important factor For me a very sad attempt and should be avoided
1,In another one of Bugs Bunnys hareraisingly wacky shorts the famous leporid works in a department store display case when owner Gildersleeve decides to stuff him Of course this proves nearly impossible as Bugs apparently knows the store better than Gildersleeve and knows when to crossdress As always they keep everything coming at top speed and so you have to wonder how hilarious this cartoon must have seemed when it first debuted Among other things Hare Conditioned is a fine example of how the Looney Tunes looked in the 40s before the Termite Terrace crowd polished them But dont get me wrong the cartoons were still really good after the refined forms arrived Anyway this is a great one Leporids are rabbits and hares
0,I am very disappointed because I expected a real ride as promised in the many reviews The script is very bad with lot of holes and the direction too The director failed completely to develop each violent scene with thrills and suspense It tries very hard to follow a wannabe thriller Therefore I had to watch how every bullet was spent without giving any sense to me I was always asking what kind of movie I am watching Then I didnt like that she smoked aggressively one cigarette after the other but perhaps the film was supported partly by the tobacco industry The end is also very disappointing I cannot understand how Jodie Foster could have been nominated for the Golden Globe in this worst role of her life Jodie therefore I liked very much PANIC ROOM or FLIGHT PLAN This is definitely one of the worst I have ever seen 410
1,Wow I loved this movie and LOVE Judy Marte This girl isnt just an awesome pretty face shes funny and really really talented She made me laugh many times just by being very naturally rough with Victor who was desperately hitting on her Well be seeing her a lot in the next coming years and probably also from director Peter Sollett and costar Victor Rasuk Raising Victor Vargas is one of the best film I saw in a long time Very refreshing Its true nice funny well filmed it got it all  good story good actors good film direction If you like simple slow paced real life urban movies like maybe Jersey Girl from Kevin Smith youll love Victor Vargas Its better
1,Chanwook Park you have to hand it to the guy In my eyes hes not only a brilliant director but a brilliant director who can turn his hand to any genre and often provides something refreshing yet still ultimately satisfying Thirst is essentially a vampire tale but one that plays fast and loose with some of the rules of the subgenre Kangho Song plays Father Sanghyeon a man who unselfishly gives himself over to a research program and then unselfishly kind of catches the disease they are trying to cure dies and comes back All thanks to the blood he was transfused with Being the only one out of five hundred to survive he becomes quite the celebrity to those who know him and all he wants is to get back to normal Normal however now involves being able to leap great distances without injury wanting to drink blood and getting severely hot under the collar when rays of sun get on his skin Its not long before hes living with a rather dysfunctional family unit who knew him in his childhood and while he hides his new strange lifestyle he finds himself drawn into a complex love triangle becoming more acceptable of darker thoughts and sliding down a slippery slope that could lead him from man to beast to monster Deftly blending a number of genres Parks movie felt much fresher and more original to me than Let The Right One In to use a recent example and genuinely impressed me with its approach to material that could easily have felt as wellworn and rehashed as any number of other vampire movies weve seen over the years Its a mixture of horror melodrama and comedy while also pondering ideas such as strength of faith the power over life and death the downside of immortality etc etc Some people have complained that this genreblending approach weakens the movie but I personally found that it was a lively entertaining and always enjoyable movie helped by a great central performance from Song as the tortured priest and fantastic turns from a supporting cast with no weak links Many characters get to move through a range of emotions and all do so with skill and believability especially the young woman played by OKvin Kim who becomes the object of the priests love lust and affection Fans of Asian cinema and Park in particular and also fans of Poes The Telltale Heart watch and learn should lap this up its yet another classy movie from a man who seems to take everything in his stride and always manages to put out nothing less than solid entertainment See this if you like Cronos Near Dark Dellamorte Dellamore AKA Cemetery Man
1,First off I hadnt seen The Blob since I was 7 or 8 and viewing it as an adult was an incredible experience Pages could be written on its influence on horror films even today And even more could be written on its social subtext with the 50s fear of teenagers But this simple little tale of interplanetary horror is still a damn fine scary movie if you let it be Sure it looks cheesy as all get out in our modern world But The Blob packs in some genuinely frightening moments as a band of kids track the unstoppable creature when then adults dont believe them In fact there are even some pretty bleak moments in its candycolored world And Steve McQueen gives so much more than the story deserved on paper that we the viewers really get caught in the moment and believe in him To sum up if you can take off your postmodern irony filter theres a lot more to love here than meets the eye
1,One of the greatest crimes made against Scifi television was the cancellation of Farscape One of the most wellwritten wellacted and overall best shows ever to grace the airwaves it set new standards for Scifi television Once the flagship highest rated critically acclaied show of the SciFi Channel it defies explaination as to why shows like Buffy Tremors The Series and even StarGate SG1 have lasted as long as they have Yes even Buffy But Ill save my Buffy bashing for another time Farscape was poorly treated by the SciFi channel continually tossed around in scheduling reruns rarely shown and never really advertised But while the show has been cancelled all those involved in the production of the show want to bring the show back even Henson Company CEO Brian Henson There is also an extensive fanbased movement to bring the show back  Overall things are looking far from dark and hopefully fans will get their season 5
1,This film is the most romantic in years David Duchovny is superb HeÂ´ll make you cry smile and dream Minnie driver and James Belushi are very good too But David is astonish DonÂ´t miss the opportunity to see this little film and fall in love with Bob and Grace Run donÂ´t walk
0,George Cukors The Women remains one of the glittering gems of 1939 Hollywoods most golden of golden years The film crackled and sparked and its absence of males was a subtle touch hardly noticed because of all the fine entertainment Flash forward We see Fifth Avenue in New York City in front of Saks Large crowds bustle along the Avenuebut somethings off The shot reveals only well dressed attractive and young women Creepier than I Am Legend the visual concept continues inside the store and later at a large fashion show What NYC fashion show doesnt have at least 5 gay men The no men rule is rammed down our throats creating an alien world off balance and distracting Enter Meg Ryan first seen digging in her garden wearing a ridiculous getup complete with her retro curls and flailing arms I immediately sympathized with her husband and could understand why he looked elsewhere Later in the film she morphs into an older Jennifer Aniston look and keeps her arms at her sides This seems intentional as if to say Look I can still be relevant Ryans character is loaded down with a coven of missmatched friends insert Sex and the City comparison here who if it were real life would despise each other Annette Bening plays the power bitch who during the course of the film realizes her lifes dream doesnt really make her happy Jada Pinkett Smith is the power lesbian all atitudinous with no use for any of the men who arent there Debra Messing is some sort of baby factory that eats a lot Eva Mendes is an odd choice for the bad girl to say the least She looks fake acts fake and any humor she tries to demonstrate falls flat Someones comment on here that she looked transgender was spot on Other various stars show up to rearrange the furniture on this Titanic The only thing that would have saved this would have been the brilliant casting of Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie They could have named their price tucked their tongues firmly into their cheeks and pulled off something very clever and profitable But no Hollywood thinks of itself way too highly for that kind of exploitation Instead were given this thing that lumbers along awkwardly with no sparkle Entire sections of dialog from the original are lifted and plopped down into a scene with awful results At one point Ryan exclaims something along the lines of This isnt a 1930s movie No Meg its not
0,This movie has beautiful scenery Unfortunately it has no plot In order to have a plot there must be a conflict This movie had none It spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and failed to ever place any activity in it The picture tries to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story telling If you love Montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just dont expect a story There isnt one
0,I have read the whole A wrinkle in time book and then saw the movie The movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was 190 pages and the film was 2 hours it felt really crammed in with too many effects and bad acting A wrinkle in time is about a girl named Meg Charles Wallace and Calvin must team together to find Megs father and get off the island Camazotz  The beginning of the film is really a stinker The acting is awful the direction is laughable and so far the situations arent necessary I really was crushed to see the same person Madeleine Engle that wrote the book and created the movie made a great book and a terrible film The acting is worse than any straighttovideo acting Yes I got to admit there was cool effects But seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible If you read the book you will be crushed by the movie I wish could give it a 0 but sadly I can only give it 1 A half could have been useful
0,If this is a 2008 product from one of the biggest production houses of Indian Film Industry Yash Raj then I am afraid it is a very long ahead for us to reach the right standards If you can go wrong to this length with such an enormous star cast of Anil Akshay Saif and Kareena then movie making is still to be studied much harder by everyone associated with this film The film lacks in almost all departments except cinematography and Akshay Kumar He has a few good dialogues to render but that alone cannot make you enjoy a flick with huge expectations The first scene of a car going down into a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon film That itself was a clear indicator of the directors vision Every actor who otherwise is an asset to a movie is simply wasted Anil Kapoors gimmick of attempting good English falls flat most of the times And Saif will surely hit himself thinking why he signed this movie In short ITS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF RESOURSES AFTER JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM I would say that even Aaja Nachle was a better enjoyable movie than this One cannot understand how and why this kind of script was written and approved The most unwanted was the flashback sequence of Akshays love story After the faulty script the weakest point of the movie is its music Vishal Shekhar have given just some filler tunes to each song The songs start off very well and suddenly the tunes drop drastically Only one song Falak Tak Chal is somehow good of all in the lot An opportunity wasted by Vishal Shekhar Regarding the continuity intelligence of the makers just sample this  Akshay and Saif are on the road in the hilly area of a foreign Location probably Ladakh In the next scene they are searching for Kareena in Haridwar and then back in the hills with Kareena in the dicky of their car I am still thinking who wrote this If you manage to sit till the last then the climax is too long with silly and unnecessary stunts You can see all the heroes walking through the storm of bullets not hurt as if they are GOD Are we still seeing a 2008 movie with all these technical heights achieved So no more words on this pathetic and downgrade movie but a sincere request to senior actors from their fan Dear Anil Kapoor  Akshay Kumar If possible please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out As artists of such stature you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers People still clap for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively I think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it hampers the reputation of all associated with the movie the actors and the production house both
1,The film begins with Vincent Price about to begin his performance as a magician However midway through the very successful show the police come and shut him down It seems that his old boss had cheated him out of the tricks Price had createdeven those he made on his own time at home As a result Price justifiably kills the evil man The problem is that while the viewer understood why Price killed and most probably thought this was a GOOD thing because Price was a bit mad he just couldnt stop at one sort of like eating Lays Potato Chips The film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks including a huge circular saw and a crematorium for the shows great plot twists as well as exciting action One thing you cant say about this film is that it is dull While its also far from subtle it is fun throughout though and well worth a look Had I never seen Vincent Prices version of HOUSE OF WAX I probably would have liked THE MAD MAGICIAN a lot more and scored it an 8 or 9 Thats because while THE MAD MAGICIAN is a wonderful film its highly reminiscent of the film that preceded it HOUSE OF WAX The bottom line is that since HOUSE OF WAX was so successful the formula was rehashed in the followup film Both were made in 3D both have a plot where Price has every justification to kill but he cant stop once hes committed the first and both are great fun to watch The biggest differences and there are few are that HOUSE OF WAX was in color and was more of a horror film and THE MAD MAGICIAN was definitely more of a mystery My advice is to see this film AND HOUSE OF WAX the Price version only They are both terrific 1950s horror films
1,Gary Buseys best performance in a nicelyflowing biography Since had a musical background he was able to do his own songs and it really works Its always good to see that fine actor Don Stroud one of the crickets and Charlie Martin Smith as well An 8 out of 10 Best performance  Gary Busey Thankfully Mr Busey was Oscarnominated for this losing to Jon Voight in COMING HOME A fairly lowbudget flick that doesnt disappoint with GREAT SONGS by Mr Holly I hope this made plenty of dough Busey was never this popular again for varying reasons but thankfully he has this one great one on his resume
1,I just finished watching this film For me the most outstanding work in this film was the music score While many silent film scores work very well with their scenes I feel that this is the best score Ive come across The mutiny scenes in particular worked extremely well
1,Nolls comfortable way of rolling out blunt comments often with expletives to describe things that he is more knowledgeable about than most is quite refreshing There is one other character in the film that constantly tries to verbalize complicated issues using more language than necessary This guy should never have been given a Thesaurus Cut to Noll and you know youre in for a treat The way the pioneers of big wave surfing are portrayed is very evocative of a lost era Nevermind the fact that no one knows how these guys made a living much less took care of issues like medical care The use of old film clips throughout was masterfully done
0,Being a fan of cheesy horror movies I saw this in my video shop and thought I would give it a try Now that Ive seen it I wish it upon no living soul on the planet I get my movie rentals for free and I feel that I didnt get my moneys worth Ive seen some bad cheesy horror movies in my time hell Im a fan of them but this was just an insult
0,Man this movie sucked big time I didnt even manage to see the hole thing my girlfriend did though Really bad acting computer animations so bad you just laugh woman to werewolf strange clips the list goes on and on Dont know if its just me or does this movie remind you of a porn movie And I dont mean all the naked ladys Its something about the light or something This could maybee become a classic just because of the bad acting and all the naked women but not because its an original movie white a nice plot twist My final words are Dont see it Its not worth the time If you wanna see it because the nakedness theres lots of better ones to see
0,I give this movie 3 out of 10 because I have watched zillions of movies and I can tell clearly what an intellectual movie with a mindteasing message should look like Definitely The Broken is not one of those movies I have to admit that the movie made me think a lot trying to understand what the whole thing was trying to lead to and despite the explanations Ive read in prior comments they seemed only an exaggeration just to have one self in the intellectual league of people the photo on the cover clearly shows that the Broken is the broken upper piece of the face which normally contains the brain Its a clear message that once this part of the body is broken the rest will be deformed and lifeless So you start waiting on the movie characters to show their defected sides and this is not obvious in any of the scenes because the movie starts right away without any introduction to the characters and their lives before Though we see the father holding a rifle when his children try to surprise him as if he is aware he has enemies but still this is not a very strong clue Had the clues been planted more in the movie one would have said about that it is a masterpiece indeed But though the movie was so slow in pace it was at the same time so empty with no metaphorical scenes at all And the reuniting of the evil dad with the evil Gena at the end is a strong refuting evidence of the existential messages that some people spoke about in other comments Furthermore if Gena truly lives in the apartment as her brother tells her at the end then how come she is the evil one I bet I can defy any theory about this movie with so many questions that can only lead to one conclusion This movie is a pretentious one and a waste of time Obviously it shows someone trying to make out of a meaningless mystery something which is of no value at all I am a huge fan of horror movies and specially slasher ones that some people call popcorn movies Horror movies are not supposed to convey deep messages Theyre supposed to uncover the beautiful mask of life and show you the other dark side of it which is the truest I guess Horror movies should have blood screams intensity skeletons body organs and parts Because that is the real horror and its never away from reality I have watched almost all horror movies and I can prove that each one of them can be as real as the sunrising Nothing is unreal as long as the mind had thought of For instance the horror movie Train with all the slashing and tensity of it and its similarity almost in everything with Hostel it speaks about a very real thing which is selling body organs illegally by abducting people in foreign places where no one would ask or search for them And even if we considered the Broken a movie that has an existential message it is still very poorly presented and the least scary I prefer the addiction message presented in Requiem for a Dream which went beyond drug addiction to highlight the fact that any kind of addiction whether for sex TV safetybeing pampered etc can be so destructive and it scared the hell out of me And those who always criticize horror movies for being meaningless and very commercial are usually just bunch of people who get scared easily and simply dont like this genre but this doesnt mean that there are fans of such movies and that they have a lot to offer to the viewer from adrenaline turmoils ecstasy leadership lessons believe it or not entertainment to most importantly the face to face interview with the essence of life as ugly and scary as it may seems Death
1,I put this movie on not expecting much other than a B movie gore fest Thankfully I was presented with a very well made film that built up the suspense and managed to maintain it throughout its run time This was an impressive achievement The acting was solid creating characters that you cared about and related to and although some may find the film slow it did force you to think about what you would have done in the same situation Added to this there was some fine camera work and the directors pulled it all together admirably An excellent effort then that is well worth your time if you prefer development and suspense over gore
0,This is so incredibly bad Poor actors You can tell theyre trying really hard to polish a turd but we all know you cant The writing is so obvious and facile its sad watching them try to sell it The humor and pacing are so labored its hard to believe any of these good actors signed on for this That said its so awful that were having a hard time looking away from the screen We just have to know where this trainwreck goes But thats only because we caught it on TV If we had actually PAID for this wed be disgusted  So it gets 2 stars for being at least amusinglyfascinatingly bad And the incidental music as opposed to the tryingtoohard indie soundtrack is laughably reminiscent of an episode of ScoobyDoo but not as good
0,OK first of all who in their right mind would remake Hitchcock and second who would do it shot for shot I admit I had no intention of ever watching this movie for that very reason The original Psycho is one of my favorite films ever and this just seemed like a degrading photocopy of it I did watch it because my girlfriend wanted to compare it to the original and we both agreed less than five minutes into this crap that it was awful First as mentioned they did it shot for shot Wheres originality Why remake a movie that is almost perfect EXACTLY the way it was done the first time Why remake such a movie to begin with If you ARE going to remake something remake something that doesnt work and make it BETTER Second they used the exact same script from the 1960 version The dialog no longer works It works fine and sounds perfect for the 1960 version but seems odd and stilted coming out of modern actors Why not update the dialog Hitch didnt write the script you could have rewritten  This film had some very good talent and they were wasted by imitation of the original actors The actor who played the car salesman seemed like he was just playing John Andersons performance as the car salesman in the original All the actors seemed like the only direction they were given was be the characters from the original movie Vince Vaughn may have seemed a little creepier than Anthony Perkins but in doing so you loose the sympathy you are supposed to have for Norman Having Norman masturbate while watching Marion undress was going too far and lost the innocence of the character that I think Tony Perkins captured so well in his performance Viggo Mortensens accent was annoying and Rita Wilson was far too old to play Caroline Her lines came off as someone desperate rather than just young and fun like Patricia Hitchcocks performance  The only good thing I saw about the film was that Gus Van Sant was able to open the movie with the shot Hitch had envisioned Hitch wanted to open with 1 long shot going over Phoenix but couldnt at the time so he had to settle for a series of shots crossdissolved together This film fulfilled that vision with a helicopter shot going into the window of the hotel After that though the film became a worthless waste of celluloid  If you are curious about how to destroy a wonderful film watch this but do NOT under any circumstances watch this BEFORE you watch the original This is a faded photocopy of the original and should never have been greenlit Stick to the masters film not the imitation
0,Historically awful Scarcely an accurate moment in 4 hours of ridiculosity One cannot keep track of the inconsistencies while watching As with all track and filed movies nobody bothers to ask for any track consultants Events and techniques that werent even created until the next century are shown From the shots of runners jogging in a 400 meters to the highly overweight actor portraying the high jump and long jump winner one would have to know absolutely nothing about track to even be mildly entertained Likely thrown together in 1984 as a tribute to the games just prior to the LA Olympics
0,Notwithstanding that The House of Adam is meant to be a mainstream gay movie that Anthony John Shaw who is gay curious and a major cutiehunk and Adam Jared Cadwell who is openly gay and a close second in looks that there is a whole minute of wonderful convincing and naked lovemaking sorry no frontal between Anthony and Adam 41 minutes into the movie that alone may be sufficient for many of us  notwithstanding all that to which I give a thumbs up The House of Adam is a horrible movie by most any other movie making standard A big thumbs down Shaws and Cadwells acting abilities are either sophomoric or else truly suffer from the bad script direction and editing or rather the lack thereof Their lovemaking scene is nevertheless convincing and may have more to do with their really being into each other considering the rest of their scripting and acting Writerdirector Jorge Amers Bonus Feature selfcongratulation as to his movie making skills is off the wall So the script and lack thereof is a thumbs down Overall the acting is thumbs down with just the slightest exception for Shaw and Cadwell Alexis Karriker as Nina might have been the best except for the limitations expressed above Far and away the absolute worst and insufferable acting was by Thomas Michael Kappier as Albert Ross Anthonys father having not even of elementary school acting quality He truly represents a colossal casting failure The actors playing the new cabin owners are worthy of truly bad acting nominations as well If only the production editing and post production were as good as the trailer this movie would have been quite something else The trailer presents well put together clips of scenes that drew me into renting the movie in the first place That and the hope that this gaycentered movie was supposedly prominently played and touted at gay film festivals Overall the movie is a big thumbs down Is it worth buyingrenting and watching it Only if you have an irresistible yen to see the naked love making scene and a few minutes of semiconvincing dialogue between Anthony and Adam Or if you truly just enjoy watching bad movies
1,This is the best dub Ive ever heard by Disney as well as the best adaptation since the biggest abuse ever on soundtrack themes characters dialogues in Kiki Delivery Service Urrrghhh This one has different atmosphere especially the deviation from the common heroine This one has both hero and heroine although I dont really endorse the use of hero  heroine here since Miyazaki is out from the stereotype  common theme As usual after being introduced by Spirited away amazed by Mononoke troubled by Grave of Fireflies and deeply touched by Majo no Takkyuubin  this one start with a bit doubt in my part Wondering if this will be the first Ghibis dud Well in the end just like Only Yesterday and Whisper of the Heart I ended up giving 10 rating Id give 98 rating but the additional 02 is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to see the movie SPOILER Somehow I see this as a sad movie people die in this one the lonely robot the abandoned place and it ends with destruction It is as if mankind really cant live with too much power The collapsing scene gave me patches of Metropolis ending Its just sad somehow The plot is apparent in most reviews and the soundtrack rules as well as always Joe Hisaishi really belongs to Uematsu Kanno Williams caliberPeople who can brings a movie a game an event to life even to be a lingering moments by astounding composition This is a feel good movie that used to be part of US cinema in the classic days Its a Wonderful Life etc etc Well things change
0,In director Eric Stanzes ISOYC IPOYG three men are subjected to torture at the the hands of a woman that they have all sexually abused The first victim is forced to eat his own crap before being axed to death The next bloke ends up with a bullet in the crotch after refusing to have anal sex with the first guys corpse But its the third man who gets it the worst he has to watch the heavily tattooed star Emily Haack get naked and masturbate with a broom handle oh he also gets the handle shoved up his butt too And unfortunately so do we get to see her masturbate that isÂ—not get a broom handle up our butts Yes ISOYC IPOYG is one harsh viewing experience not because of its relentless violence but because Haack who is obviously under the misguided notion that she has the body of a goddess as opposed to that of a roadie for Metallica constantly gets buck naked for the camera It aint a pretty sight In addition to the nonstop nudity from an inkedup Haack viewers also get to see dreadful direction from Stanze who thinks that endless shots of tombstones and trees is entertaining stuff some really bad acting and a fat guys penis Strangely enough I give ISOYC IPOYG a rating of 310 which is actually slightly higher than its current 29 average Thats one point for the messy axe attack which being a gorehound I actually enjoyed one point for the bit where the fat guy gets his face pushed in chocolate mousse masquerading as feces hilarious and one point for the sheer nerve to suggest that this film might somehow be a sequel to Meir Zarchis superior exploitation classic I Spit On Your Grave
0,Welcome to Collinwood is kind of a disaster Considering the people involved it shouldve been multiple times better Watching it if youre at least somewhat attached to the faith that itll get better will probably make you cry Its one of those movies that had potential but was robbed of this potential thanks to a terrible script and some bad acting not to mention the strangely annoying and unnecessary George Clooney character and the guy who reminds me of Richard Dreyfuss but about whom I care so little that I dont even want to know his name The films only saving grace is the weird con vocabulary it introduces I found myself thinking of it time and time again as I watched more crime capers This is the only reason I gave the film a 3 The plot is boring the characters are neurotic needlessly offensive and highly unlikable They are in a constant state of agonizing stress and theyre all so irritating that I celebrated their obstacles They yell at each other and swear crassly The dialogue is insipid at best and insultingly stupid at its low points I find that Steven Traffic Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and George Clooney are to blame for this They should be tried for war crimes if anyone actually remembers this crap long enough to care
0,Dull onenote characters with next to no development unimpressive performances by people who sound like theyre simply reading lines and ludicrous special effects combine to make this a genuine stinker The story begins with eminently bland commando Russo and his fellow soldiers attacking an AlQaeda training base The scene tells us that AlQaeda has recently come to seek an ultimate weapon and also serves to illustrate Russos only character trait a tendency to eschew teamwork With the help of a collection of blank slates and walking stereotypes including a Russian spy Russo travels to Chechnyan territory to catch a mad scientist working for the terrorists Along the way they encounter vast hordes of flesheating bats that fly in broad daylight for some reason From there the movie becomes nothing more than a dragging morass of ridiculous action including a scene in which a swarm of bats slices a soldiers arm off
0,My daughter liked it but I was aghast that a character in this movie smokes As if it isnt awful enough to see product placement actors like Bruce Willis who smoke in their movies  at least children movies should be more considerate I wonder was that intentional Did big tobacco sponsor the film What does it take to ban smoking from films At least films intended for children and adolescents My daughter liked it but I was aghast that a character in this movie smokes As if it isnt awful enough to see product placement actors like Bruce Willis who smoke in their movies  at least children movies should be more considerate I wonder was that intentional Did big tobacco sponsor the film What does it take to ban smoking from films At least films intended for children and adolescents
1,Televised in 1982 from a Los Angeles production this is probably the finest example of a filmed stage musical you are likely to encounter Issued on DVD in 2004 in a remastered digital transfer it is quite stunning Hearn and Lansbury give the performances of their lives and the rest of the cast are quite obviously caught up in the electricity generated Of course it is Sondheims music and lyrics that make this possible If anyone doubts that he is one of the greats of the American Musical form listen to this The sets are stark as befits the plot and clever in allowing the swift scene changes required and the cameras catch the action without obliterating the fact that this is a stage production A central moveable and revolving platform is Mrs Lovetts pie shop with the barbers shop upstairs Around it are various gantries and moving stairs to allow the rest of the action to take place The brutal tale of injustice leading to revenge murder and mayhem is liberally spiced with dark humour and comic moments Sondheim does for barber shops what Hitchcock did for showers  An important work in American musical theatre is here given an electrifying performance
0,OkulThe School is a result of a new trend in Turkish cinema Having used the same stories over and over again new generation directors finally come up with different ideas Of course it doesnt mean that they are all grand I think Okul is one of them It is supposed to be a scary movie but it is not It is not successful on being scary either So what is it Actors are so average especially Deniz Akkaya is pretty annoying with the teacher role I am sure it could have been better if it was tried on harder Maybe concentrating on one topic such as making it scary or vice versa But directors have missed the target this time  out of 
1,I have to admit right off the top Im not a big fan of family films these days Most of them IMHO are sentimental crap But this one like TOY STORY the previous film from Pixar is a lot of fun The two lead characters were perhaps a bit too blandespecially compared to the two leads in ANTZ but otherwise this film is better but the rest of the film more than made up for it The animation looked great the humor though broad was consistently goodI especially liked Hoppers line If I hadnt promised Mother on her deathbed that I wouldnt kill you I would kill you and the actors doing the voices except the two leads were all terrificDenis Leary doing an animated movie what a concept And like everyone else I loved the outtakes I hope the video has the new ones
0,A couple of days after writing about how garbage like MAD COWS and THIS FILTHY EARTH receive money while Ange  Duncan and Theo are totally ignored I had to sit through yet another British movie  that had me scratching my head as to why it received a single penny  Some people may claim that because DEAD BABIES is based upon a highly regarded novel it has an in built market but both THIS FILTHY EARTH and MAD COWS were also adapted from novels and they were an ordeal to sit through as well  I had read the synopsis of the plot where a bunch of high class wasters go to a remote mansion where theyre stalked by an internet cult but to be honest this isnt really how the story unravels and anyone expecting Friday THE 13TH meets THE SHINING is going to be bitterly disappointed since 9095 of the running time is taken up with said characters taking drugs and discussing sex  And what hateful characters they are too  Not one of them is likable in any way and within minutes youll be getting nostalgic for Stalin  Mao and Pol Pot hoping that next time someone embarks on communist democide theyll be successful in creating an egalitarian utopia  Anything that will signal the end of such decadent bourgeois meaningless that the hateful characters in this movie embark upon can only be welcomed  Not content with giving us a movie where the plot is meandering and where the audience fail to connect with the characters the director continues to spoil things further by getting all clever and arty  No doubt that is to impress us so we will fall upon our knees and cry  Oh my god  what a wonderful director the way he bamboozles us with his highly artistic technique and only a worthless pleb will fail to appreciate what a god given talent this man is   Im sure the vast majority of people either screamed  How come my projects got turned down while crap like this didnt   or  WTF was the last half hour of this piece of crap all about   You might defend the movie by saying the original source novel was unfilmable and this makes the film unwatchable  I will agree that this movie is unwatchable   I know the IMDb classes this as an American movie but the style and faults with DEAD BABIES is uniquely British  Americans might think theyve got things tough with Bush but weve got Tony Blair  not to mention DEAD BABIES  MAD COWS and THIS FILTHY EARTH  No wonder everyone is ashamed to be British in the 21st century
0,I saw this movie on the strength of the single positive review and I can only imagine that guy is a shill The acting of the female lead is actually quite good but the entire film is just so excruciatingly boring I could hardly bear to sit through it This is the very definition of dullness So far this film is rated as 8 out of 10 on 7 votes That must mean the director directors girlfriend producer actress and drinking buddies have given their own film a 10 For the rest of you who simply want to be entertained or enjoy a good story avoid this This man on the street shall give it a 2 out of 10 FDA note while this movie can be used as an aide to obtaining a good nights sleep no medicinal value is implied or offered
0,After a fairly lengthy partially pixelated nude shower scene were off to the races for this Blair Witch Projectesquire horror film about three girlfriends venturing to a desolate cabin deep in the woods to get away from their hectic lives for a girls weekend out and smoke pot They meet two guys who seem friendly enough so they drink and tell ghost stories until late in the movie some of them get picked off This is a fairly slow movie with needlessly drawn out suspense scenes the bad acting cant carry the myriad of scenes where nothing happens but mindless banter and the movie as a whole is a dud a deathlyboring dud at that Nothing at all happens until the last half hour and when it did I was to numb to really care Eye Candy Ashley Totin shows TA Evy Lutzky gets topless briefly and Jennifer Hart shows her right tit  My Grade D
0,I still remember when Frog Baseball first aired on MTV In some sort of odd surreal manner the cartoon captured the stupid actions that I think every boy growing up in America engages in I cringe now thinking about how I burned a crippled grasshopper using a magnifying glass but it was interesting at the time for some reason Growing up in the 1980s we all knew stoners These were the kids who wore Iron Maiden tshirts to school grew their hair long had immature moustaches and were at least two inches taller than everyone else because they had flunked a grade or two We laughed at them because they were so stupid even when not stoned So it was easy to understand Beavis  Co because we already knew them some of us were even them To the extent that GenXers like myself would spurn the excess of the 1980s and embrace the grunge movement of the 1990s Beavis  Co were sort of a strange postmodern anthem for us Strange because like Beavis  Co we didnt care if we had an anthem It was just an inside joke that we all immediately got even if it was awful
1,Giorgino can to some people look a bit long but its one of rare real romantique adventure film It could be compare to Docter Jivago with a bit of Sleepy Holow You must see it
1,Excellent writing and wild cast The tech is poor but its obviously very low budget Looks like they didnt cut the negative but had to release on a video output In any case one of the most inventive comedies Ive seen lately The screenwriter in particular is fine
1,This series premiered on the cable TV station Comedy Central in the United States It was chopped to death and shown out of sequence This was sad for the audience it should have attracted it didnt and fell by the wayside Luckily at the same time my cable company went digital and I got the BBC Thank goodness because I got to see The League of Gentlemen in order complete and uncut  The League of Gentlemen troupe is right up there with Englands Monty Pythons Flying Circus and Canadas The Kids in the Hall Buta warning The League of Gentlemen though are one step beyond Its not only about dressing in drag and lampooning the cultural ills it goes deeper and much much darker I can tell many of you now  it will offend certain groups of people it will enrage others But remember its only comedydark dark comedy If that is not your thing dont watch If you think you KNOW dark comedy watch this  if you get angry and upset then you dont quite know DARK COMEDY  These guys got it right and right on the button They are brilliant they are excellent and I enjoyed each and every character creation Theres a COMPLETE story that is told here from episode one to the end You cannot watch this one episode at a time willy nilly that is one of the charms of this series Watch it in order See how creative and stylish and deeply disturbed these guys are No one and nothing is out of bounds That my dears is dark humor Bravo
1,Heres yet another film from the 80s that most people just dont know exists This slow picturesque the loving shots of the Montana landscapes are breathtaking and reminded me of Costners recent Open Range which also starred Robert Duval and emotionally satisfying film is the perfect type of movie to watch late one night when you cant sleep or on a listless Sunday afternoon Those in the right mood will be treated to a finely detailed and intimate look at the grief of one family and how they come back together after the youngest son accidentally shoots and kills the eldest son while hunting The performances are all top notch and quietly nuanced Glenn Close Robert Duval and Wilford Brimley are pitch perfect in their portrayals as are all the supporting players and young actors I especially liked how director Cain who unfortunately hasnt directed anything of note since this except the first Young Guns gives us quiet little glimpses into everyones personal grief We dont just see how the death effects the younger brother or the parents but also the confused middle sister the wayward uncle his crazy wife and the dead teenagers girlfriend What we essentially get here is the rural MidWestern answer to Ordinary People Theres also shades of David Lynchs The Straight Story in some of the stoic downhome MidWest morality of the folks depicted here and also in the lovingly haunting shots of the farmland they inhabit This is one of the better and more realistic tearjerkers of the era and a nice little find for you quality movie hunters out there
0,I have been a fan of the Carpenters for a long time read the biography watched the specials and saw the Karen Carpenter Story This movie really didnt show the real Karen Carpenter In the movie she seems to be a shy and a pretty much of loner except for one girl friend The real Karen Carpenter was much different She was outgoing and friendly She had lots of friends especially Olive NewtonJohn The movie doesnt even show Karens attempts for a solo album and her meeting Phil Ramone and his wife Itchy Karen Itchy knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York When Karen was in New York she did see a psychologist but it was voluntary and once a day and then she would leave to go to her hotel room Also Karen was taking pills to increase her thyroid so she could loss weight but stop taking them because the psychologist recommended her not too Also the Karens husband in the movie is named Bob Knight but in real life was named Tom Burris Also Karen wasnt divorced from Tom but only separated Karen was to sign the divorce papers on the day she died Also Agnes found Karen naked in the closet unciousness unlike in the movie where she was dressed in white The music was very good That was the only thing I would recommend on seeing it
1,Camp with a capital C Think of Mask and the Ace Ventura movies  then multiply by 100 This laughaminute entertainer takes schlock to the level of high art David Dhawan is a genius and Govinda is beyond description See it over and over again I insist
1,This was a very funny movie not Oscarworthy but definately the best dollar Ive ever spent at Blockbuster Rupert Penry Jones is a shining star and very well might be the new Jude Law So if youre in the mood for a British Teen Flick RENT IT
0,Another lame attempt to make a movie gritty and thought provoking whatever the hell that means They have Al Pacino say a lot of words like  Television killed football Yeah whatever This is another movie that showcases Oliver Stones Delusions of Grandeur If Stone is trying to show us that football will be our downfall or something why does he insist on romanticizing the sport with his stilted camera movements and Kid Rock songs He even throws Cameron Diaz into the fray for purely aesthetic reasons Its a shame that Diaz and Pacino have to meet in a movie that is so bad Ever since Scent of Woman writers and directors have used Pacino to romanticize their pathetic lines His characters are nothing more than loudspeakers  their voices covering up what would normally be redundant and trite He needs to reinvent himself showing how he can act without yelling He has to stop feeling sorry for hokey scripts with cheesy lessons like Organized football is messed up and act out a good story
0,This movie may seem scary on commercials but the actual movie was a reason to vomit This is a below below average even lower than that and has no plot I mean every house can make you feel scared and sure a dead Japanese woman would scare the poop out of you but so what Make a movie that would appeal to watchers and not just show images of scared people and some hair dead Japanese woman Can you say horrible ripoff of Samara The Ring Dont get me started with the dead child Not even that scary So what He has a cat and he can imitate it big freaking deal Just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential of being harmed by the Grudge 110 Yuck 
1,Inspirational tales about triumph of the human spirit are usually big turnoffs for me The most surprising thing about MEN OF HONOR is how much I enjoyed it in spite of myself The movie is as predictable and cliched as it gets but it works Much credit goes to the exhilarating performances by both leads Its a perfect role for Cuba Gooding Jr whos wonderfully restrained here We have come to expect a lot from De Niro and he doesnt disappoint He creates a darkly funny portrait Director George Tillman Jr set out to make an oldstyle flick and comes up with a winner
0,I can not believe such slanted jingoistic material is getting passed off to Americans as art house material Early on from such telling lines like we want to make sure they are playing for the right team and manipulative framing and lighting A Love Divided shows its true face The crass manner in which the Irish Catholics are shown as hegemonic the Protestants as peaceful and downtrodden is as poor a representation of history as early US westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and American Indians The truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the Irish Catholics in the story a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves It is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for its obvious intent so far from attempting art This film has no business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library
0,Lets get one thing straight I like much of Snipes work Unlike his other highkicking contemporaries Seagal and Van Damme he can actually act This film however does little to enhance his reputation its not exactly unwatchable  but I am not in any hurry to watch it again either In fact if I never saw it again it wouldnt bother me  there are just loads of better films out there to waste my on Its a pity because with a bit of imagination and and some subtle changes this could have been a worthwhile film Instead the director has chosen to almost try and bludgeon his audience into submission with too much overthetop violence and very little characterisation The biggest problem I have is with Snipes costar Silvia Colloca It baffles me that the producers of this film went to all the bother of hiring a stunning beautiful for my money anyway and talented actress like Miss Colloca and then give her such a pathetic onedimensional character to play with If she was hired to simply add a bit of glamour to the movie she doesnt even do that very well theres no nudity in the film and also no sex scene worth mentioning Strange really Given the amount of violence in this film it baffles me why the producers have taken such a conservative attitude to sex and nudity Are we living in 2007 or in 1957 What the producers of this rubbish and probably the actors as well have forgotten is that films are meant to be fantasies Like most of the inhabitants of this planet my real life is very boring I would love to be chasing terrorists be able to handle myself like Mr Snipes and hook up with a beautiful young thing like Miss Colloca This film satisfies none of those fantasies very well Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review
0,This film is an almost complete waste of time I am studying the book for my English A level and the film only contributes in one way and thats getting across that the whole scenario is set in a rural idyll The acting is wooden the filmography is laughable and the so called dramatic scenes in the film had the majority of my class including me snickering into their texts The book although not my favourite literary choice is miles better than the film is and the sound track is just plain irritating Dont watch this film unless you are looking for a timeless quality storyline transformed into mindless media waste
1,Caught this film at the Arizona International Film Festival I wasnt expecting a lot though the festivals director told me it was one of the best films submitted Five minutes into it I was sold Shot in B  W on a shoestring budget this film is hilarious The acting is solid the writing is solid and the look of the film is solid The acting is probably the biggest revelation since most films shot on low budgets tend to have amateur or stagey acting Not this one It features one of the most convincing endearing and funny portrayals of a character with Tourettes Syndrome Ive ever seen The plot is convoluted without being confusing and raunchy without being gratuitous If you get the chance see this movie Filmmakers like Majkowski hope I got that right deserve the chance to strut their stuff to a wider audience
0,Think of this film as a Saturday morning liveaction program from ages ago Even the small tykes will find this one hard to please because it runs like molasses I cant fully understand how god awful it is to make something too typical and uninteresting especially in the costume department Too many warriorwizard movies out there have used the same old plotline numerous times over but this is mighty scarce considering its appeal to the little darlings And who in the world wouldve let a topless mermaid be cast in the first place I thought this was a family movie MST3K heres another fine gem for your 1999 TV season
0,This movie was rented for free I had no misconception about this being a very bad movie I rented it for Thanksgiving because we eat turkey and then the family watches an awful movie So you ask what makes this movie so bad you gave it only 2 stars Dialog The lack of dialog makes this a movie perfect for a deaf audience In fact if you rent this just turn the volume down to zero and pop in any heavy metal CD from your favorite artist I know you will enjoy it better The plot of this holiday turkey was so encumbered with tech and geek speak you need a translator for the narrative Now for all you people who enjoy good scifi effects eh they are not much better than video game trailers or cut scenes in cases worse The actors um both of them are not much to look at either They say nothing much through out the entire movie Many of the technical aspects will make you laugh like the scene where the hero straps herself to a missile and fires it at the city 70km away it never showed how she landed The scene before that we see a robotic sentry fire at her with a cannon from 12 feet away and he misses multiple shots Also we are told that the political division between the antagonist and protagonist is biotech genetically enhanced humans vs cybertech machine enhanced humans but both seem to be cyborgs or enhanced humans What told me this was a bad movie at the rental store was the cover that looked like a video game cover art and there was only the one copy good new releases have many copies available
1,Taiwanese director Ang Lee whose previous films include Sense and Sensibility and The Ice Storm turned to the American Civil War for his latest feature Based on a novel by Daniel Woodrell it follows the exploits of a group of Southern guerrillas known as bushwhackers as they fight their Northern equivalents the jayhawkers in the backwater of Missouri As one might expect there is plenty of visceral action but the focus is on the tension that the war put on the young men who fought it  many of whom were fighting against their former neighbours and even family Jake Roedel Tobey Maguire is such a man or rather boy as he is only seventeen when the war reaches Missouri He is the son of a German immigrant but instead of following his countrymen and becoming a Unionist he joins his lifelong friend Jack Bull Chiles Skeet Ulrich and rides with the bushwhackers Despite a lack of acceptance because of his ancestry and an unwillingness to participate in the murder of unarmed Union men he remains loyal to the cause So does his friend Daniel Holt Jeffrey Wright a black slave freed by another bushwhacker and so fighting for the South Lee handles the subject with aplomb never rushing the deep introspection that the plot demands in favour of action and this lends the film a sense of the reality of war  long periods of boredom and waiting interposed with occasional flashes of intensely terrifying fighting The action is unglamorised and admirably candid recognising that both sides committed a great number of atrocities The performances are superb with Maguire and Wright both courageous and dignified Upandcoming Irish actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers is particularly chilling as a coldblooded killer while Skeet Ulrich is enjoyably suave and arrogant Lee never flinches from the reality of war but his actors do an admirable job of showing the good that comes from it  the growth of friendship the demonstration of courage and on a wider scale the emancipation of oppressed peoples Ride With the Devil is a beautiful and deeply compassionate film that regularly shocks but always moves the audience
1,For me Late Chrysanthemums was interesting not only because it was my first film of Naruse I completely enjoyed but because it was technically as modern and innovative as his 30s work Ive seen This doesnt mean innovative editing in the way Godard would introduce it with Breathless in 1959 but quite the opposite The editing was as fluent as in the best of Hollywood films from the 30s40s but at the same time incredibly fitting regarding the way he was telling his story Unlike them it never purposefully accentuated anything or tried to make itself invisible but together with the cinematography made me feel like I was traveling on a gentle stream constantly feeling the waves beneath me like a gentle stroke of the hand or the almost unnoticeable rocking of a cradle In this sense the film was comparable to Ozus and Mizoguchis work but somehow even more subtle What was so modern was the fact that the editing seemed almost a character in itself similar to the remarkable camerawork in Dreyers Ordet 1954 or Vredens dag 1943 which is revealing us a deeper understanding of the film and its characters rather than simply showing them to us I feel that Naruses editing and cinematography are the most interesting aspects of his films elevating the stories significance beyond the obvious The wonderful sets and settings shouldnt be forgotten either I found the story itself to be rather conventional The narrative and its characters were introduced in a very interesting way and I thought that the first half of the film was setting up a delicately ingenious spectrum of emotions and interrelations Unfortunately the second half of the film and its resolution were rather didactic and and formulaic compared to the set up though by itself it would have been perfectly fitting in any other  less complex  film Somehow I felt that he failed a bit in trying to dissolve the many layers he had woven Maybe he should have kept them intact This criticism might seem a bit harsh to a viewer of this film especially since the procedure is again reminiscent to the way Ozu dealt with the plot in his films Unfortunately I havent yet the feeling that Naruse was able to elevate the story and its characters in his films conclusions in a similarly sublime fashion The best efforts I have seen to date  Ukigumo Floating Clouds  1955 and Midaregumo Scattered Clouds  1967  sustained the energy he had built throughout the narrative while delivering poignant and resonant endings This is already more than most directors are able to do and in my opinion the basis for a real mastery of the cinematic medium In this regard and considering the resonance of the last two films Ive seen by him he may have already become one of my favorites The only problem I have at the moment is where Im going to see more of his films on the big screen
0,Some wonder why there werent anymore Mrs Murphy movies after this one Will its because this movie totally blew snot Disney was not the right studio to run this film MAYBE Touchstone well theyre owned by Disney but itd be more adult The film is too kidish as the book series is not The casting is all wrong for the characters The characters dont even act the way they do in the books And why was Tucker changed to a guy Hes a girl in the frigging books Was this done to make the film appeal to boys Sheesh And where was Pewter the gray cat One of the funniest characters from the book is absent from this filth Rita Mae Brown is a good writer but letting Disney blow her work was wrong An animated feature film perhaps in the vane of Don Bluths artwork would suit a better Mrs Murphy film Overall I give this a 2 because at least Disney made a film from an underappreciated book series But I wish they did better Either way I still have my books to entertain me
0,AntiTrust could have been a great vehicle for Rachael Leigh Cook but the director cut out her best scenes In the scenes that she are in she is just a zombie She is involved in a subplot that is simular to a subplot in Get Carter but she handles the subplot better in Get CarterI blame the director The directors homage to Hitchcock was corny Its the scene were Ryan Philippes charactor realizes he may not be able to trust Tim Robbins charactor at least I think its a homage to Hitchcock The DVD shows the scenes that were cut out I think the director should have trust his instincts and not listen to the test audiences
1,A very interesting documentary  certainly a lot more than Sideways a pseudo wino drama  where the capitalist conspiracy is revealed in all its greed According to the documentary  and confirmed by the recent publication of a biography on Parker  only two men dictate the nature of wines in the world Robert Parker of Massachussets and Michel Rolland a French wine industry expert based in Bordeaux and also known as a flying winemaker The director is clever enough to insert interviews of local wine producers from many different regions of France from Sicily to Argentina and interviews of the biggest players in the industry such as the Mondavi family to uncover the wraps on the globalization of wine making and marketing A must see for anyone interested in the dark side of the industry Drinking a glass of wine will not be the same political and commercial act after watching this well made documentray
1,Who Done It contains many surefire laughs and gags It is not only one of the best Stooges films with Shemp it is one of the finest short comedies Columbia produced Director Bernds originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the Stooges but when Curly Howard suffered a careerending stroke it was tailored for the Columbia comedy team of Schilling and Lane their version was released as Pardon My Terror It obviously was too good for the Stooges to pass up and it was finally filmed by the Stooges at the end of 1947 Old Man Goodrich calls ace detectives Shemp Larry and Moe out of fear that he will be murdered When they arrive at his home Goodrich has disappeared and his niece and assorted goons try to get rid of the Stooges Will they find Goodrich and bring the niece and goons to justice  Shemp is particularly funny in this film His reactions after being given a mickey by Christine McIntyre are superb he gives his trademark sound eeebeeebeeeb and Miss McIntyre is noticeably trying not to laugh Other funny scenes the closeup of Moes mug looking through the camera lens and the inthedark fight with all cast members involved Nikko the goon played by Duke York is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a Stooges film With his kinked hair he could almost pass for a Stooge if he didnt tower over everyone else Who Done It is a gem among the Stooges films with Shemp Even diehard Curly fans will enjoy this one A true Stooge classic 9 out of 10
1,I saw this at the theater in the early 1970s The most memorable and scary scene is when the German army attacks with yellow cross mustard gas for the first time The Germans and their horses are covered from head to toe or hoof with eerie protective suits The experienced British soldiers don gas masks only and once again await the clouds of gas and the German attackers The gas clouds move ever closer finally enveloping the British defenders The Germans move forward slowly menacingly in their scary looking garb Suddenly a scream from the defenders This gas is like no other that they have experienced before  Now you will know why I have remembered this scene for the last 30 years and still shiver I think that you will too
1,This film was a surprise The plot synopsis sounds kinky and stars Clint Eastwood and the great Geraldine Page I didnt know what to expect There is that opening scene where the wounded soldier says that age 12 is old enough to kiss and proceeds to give a child a lingering and very adult mouth to mouth kiss The child takes him to the girls boarding school where she lives He takes advantage of the situation by attempting to seduce the headmistress played by Page her assistant and another student Jealousy sexual tension incest intrigue and the macabre all meld in this wonderfully original story Ive read the other comments here and find little to disagree with However I wanted to clarify a point made earlier that there are no sympathetic characters in the film I find that there is one The attractive female slave successfully resists the soldiers advances in a scene that works well because it touches upon the common history of black women slaves taken advantage of by white men Even though her strength and lack of illusion are the sum total of her experience she is what I would consider a sympathetic character She more than any of the other women and girls at the school has a legitimate reason for participating in what happens in the end
0,WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILER If you can get by the extremely unpleasant subject matter this film does offer a heaping helping of outrageously campy melodrama Surprisingly enough this movie has been copied and rippedoff several times over the years although its hard to fathom ANY filmmaker being inspired by this trashy drama Neither one of the Hemingway women can act here although Mariel HAS improved over the years Anne Bancroft offers the only touch of class as a prosecuting attorney and Chris Sarandon is by turns pathetic and unintentionally hilarious as the smirking smarmy bad guy of the piece Veteran director Lamont Johnson cant make a silk purse out of this sows ear of a script which is stuffed to bursting with howlingly bad dialogue and outlandish situations For example the final sequence where Margaux grabs her shotgun and chases Sarandon down after his latest shocking act is meant to be exciting but elicits hearty chuckles instead Add a notoriously shrill and spacy musical score by Michel Polnareff and you have a true guilty pleasure even though youre likely to feel grubby and needing a hot shower after viewing it Dont say you werent warned
0,Apparently Shakespeare equals high brow which equals in turn a bunch of folks not seeing something for what it really is At one point in this film someone I believe Pacinos producer warns him that film is getting off track that it was once about how the masses think about Shakespeare through the vehicle of RICHARD III Instead he decides to shoot a chopped up play with random comments sprinkled throughout Some scenes seemed to be included as home movies for Al was there really ANY reason for the quick visit to Shakespeares birthplace other than for a laugh about something unexpected which happens there and before the film has really even begun we are treated to seeing Al prance around and act cute and funny for the camera I thought his silly act with Kay near the end of GODFATHER III with the knife to his throat was AN ACT  but apparently its how Al really behaves in person Enough rambling Heres a shotgun smattering of why I didnt even make it 34 of the way through this 1 pretentious  Al always knows when the camera is on him whether hes acting as Richard or in a real conversation with someone  you can see it in the corner of his eyes also some of the actors around the rehearsal table become untethered and wax hammy to the extreme If anyone reading this has ever spent any time with an group of actors and has witnessed this kind of thing from the outside its unbearable Look at me chewing all the scenery 2 Winona Ryder When she appears as Lady Anne this film comes to a screeching halt which it never recovers from She has nothing to add in the discussion scenes but the camera lingers on her to bring in the kiddoes Her performance is dreadful to boot 3 the only things you really learn from this are told to you by the very scholars the filmmakers are trying to keep out of the picture Of course you also learn that Pacino shouldnt be directing films or doing Richard in the first place Id rather watch BOBBY DEERFIELD than this Lastly read the play and learn it for yourself Go out and see it performed In 1997 I saw the play performed at the University of Washington Ethnic Cultural Theater and it made what we see in this film seem like high school drama except for the gratuitous throat slashing of Clarence My God Was that necessary Its all just a bunch of sound and fury signifying nada
1,Trapped buried alive brings us to a resort that has just opened and is soon to close We start with a guy in gear blowing up drifts to avoid the possibility of avalanches somehow that doesnt make sense anyways hes about to blow away one particularly big one when he notices the resort is open despite his best efforts higher authority tells him his day is over soon as everyone expects an avalanche hits Look im not gonna reveal any more all i can say is this was a Bmovie designed for the family channel which i just saw it on and the fact it had no commercials proves its a Bmovie anyways its a pretty decent film but its partially unreal firsthand when people are buried by ice and snow theyre buried not just traced by powder or what about a CD for a screwdriver its not possible and finally what i cant stress enough is that an explosion cannot stop a avalanche guaranteed furthermore its worth a rental or a TV viewing but not owning 710 The movie is rated PG but maybe it should have received something a little more strong a boy nearly loses his foot in an elevator but his leg is cut around the ankle a guy is toasted by electricity and diesel and in the weight room dead people are laying around enjoy
0,Originally harped as a sequel to The Slumber Party Massacre series this film falls flat on its face with a new title First off if you are going to include the word massacre in your films title you better deliver This one certainly does not There is no gore no on screen murders and no chainsaw as the box art would lead you to believe Instead we get a paper thin overdone plot about a group of cheerleaders who get stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football game only to be offed one by one Again this film could have been OK if the gore quotient was upped a bit Why directors especially those doing directtovideo flicks are afraid to show ANY gore is beyond me Now I am not a huge fan of excessive gore but come onwhy else would anyone rent a movie called Cheerleader Massacre Besides that problem the film suffers from a shotonahomevideocamera cheapness It looks cheap sounds cheap and the actors arent all that good It tries to throw us off track to who the killer may be but even that fails The ending ends up being a ridiculous mess Folks if you run across this film walk away and go find the original Slumber Party Massacre 2 out of 10
1,Something I think some people miss about great science fiction is that it predicts some part of the future No other theatrical movie that I can recall predicted that when the space shuttle went to study Halleys Comet that a disaster would occur Some differences were the Churchill the shuttle in the movie actually went to the comet the Challenger was only in low earth orbit The Churchill was merely burned out inside whereas the Challenger explodedhey the vampires had to get back to earth One great similarity and this is always bad luck both had mixed malefemale crewsthe legend of Halleys comet and disaster continues Other than this there is not much more to be said about this movie that hasnt been said before As a outer spacescience fictionhorrorsex film individually it provided nothing really new but as in all great dishes it is the combination that counts And taken together this was a highly original and satisfying combination I just wish Mathilda May would drain her victims through another part of the body
0,Absolutely one of the worst movies Ive ever seen The Beginning was not the greatest either but better than this one This is not a good way to lead up to the original movie Its just simply awful The CGI hyenas were so fake looking in both movies Why not use real animals I enjoyed the old Sinbad movies better than this I was royally disappointed The only good thing I can say about this waste of film is the cinematography and clothes which really captured that era well I understand why this movie was redone as The Beginning Its just that bad in my opinion where does the money come from to waste like this Give me a multimillion dollar budget and Ill show you how it should be done
1,I saw this in 1993 on a VHS tape but have been unable to find it at any source since This is a very bleak and uncompromising look at the last days of the Japanese Army in the Phillipines Anyone with an interest in the Pacific war would do well to view this film and see what conditions the other side fought underFrom what I can tell this is historically accurate and depicts how easily men can descend into complete barbarism I understand the Japanese Army was completely cut off from any resupply in the Phillipines by 1945 so there is no doubt many of the horrific incidents depicted here happened I might not have been able to identify with the films characters but I appreciate their humanity and struggle to survive If I had to compile a list of the ten greatest war films this film would be on it See it if you can get it
1,This is filmmaking at its simplest and its best I had my doubts because even though Freeman is great actor sometimes he gets involved in bad projects this is not one of those times Its a small story that runs just over an hour and fifteen in a time when we are getting used to having movies become longer and longer and not necessarily better the director uses the short time to his advantage because the characters are so well defined from the start great portrayals by freeman and Vega by the way that the little bit of background info on them seems real Morgan is himself even though his name is not mentioned he has been out of movies for a couple of years now because he was saturated by the business and developed a fear to commit to a script and is doing research for a character in a indie movie where he plays a storesupermarket manager The story begins by him being drop of in a supermarket in a rough neighborhood where he meets the cashier of the 10 items or less Vega and has to take a ride with her cause the production forgot to pick him up In many ways its a road movie Morgan provides the laughs and quirks with his unbeatable smile and positive perspective on everything showing off an accomplished actor who has trained his mind to be able to define everyone he sees into a character he could play and Paz by the way what an extraordinary beautiful woman even more gorgeous than Penelope Cruz brings the vulnerability of a 25 years old separated woman who works harder than everyone else without getting any credit in a dead end job at a crappy supermarket Its a talkie there is a lot of dialog but the balance between light and fun and serious and sad is well sustained the characters become so lovable right away that you spend the last 20 minutes begging for more screen time of this odd couple but the shortness is in the nature of the story so it was a good call from the director not to give in
1,This film starts out with all the moody promise of a great contemporary noir Western  after the illconceived opening flashback sequence anyway The scenery is beautifully desolate the characters achingly isolated While some of the acting is less than believable the plot ultimately delivers enough tension and twists to make this movie worth a look
0,Man has been to the farthest reaches of the earth and now he is traveling to new worlds But with new worlds come ancient evils the vampires of space And not just a handful but entire tribes In this film which I saw as Bloodsuckers but I guess also goes as Vampires Wars we see what happens when the imperialist earthlings meet the imperialist vampires I will make this review very short because its undeserving of a good review The best I can say for this film is it has a good cast of blist and upcoming stars Natassia Malthe was Quintana and was far more attractive here than in Bloodrayne 2 Michael Ironside is Muco and is always a fan favorite as I say hes the poor mans Jack Nicholson And we even get CarrieAnn Fleming as Damians wife who horror fans will now recognize as the eponymous Jenifer from Dario Argentos Jenifer So this movie as bad as it is isnt without some names attached but the same can be said of Uwe Bolls work The concept of the military tracking and killing vampires in space isnt necessarily a bad idea but it easily falls into the realm of cheese and this film falls hard The acting especially from the vampires is over the top and I just didnt find the explanations of their existence very convincing Worst of all the vampire tribes have the names Voorhess and Leatherfaces I understand this was supposed to be a clever reference for the horror fans but it wasnt clever at all It just sounded dumb and out of place unlike the much more subtle references in James Gunns Slither such as naming stores after lesserknown horror directors Thats all I want to say If you can stand lots of cheese on this day I couldnt and Im from Wisconsin and want to see average actors with poor costumes fight vampires in space although space looks a lot like any other forest on earth check this one out if you can find it I dont personally recommend this when you can watch other cheesy vampires films Jon Carpenters Vampires or other cheesy space movies Or maybe even some good ones But hey do your thing
1,Old movie buffs will know why Id call this one The Man in the Grey Flannel Robe Most Biblebased movies are basically schlock what might call forth smiles and giggles here is how Peck tries to raise consciousness on a variety of psychological and social issues with the spear carrying Neanderthals all about him As a Great Romance it falls flat as unleavened bread But there is something gripping about this movie Of all the big Hollywood Bible pictures it most strikingly conveys the ambivalent attitude of the Average American towards belief in the Biblical God Billy Sundays thesis is duking it out with HL Menckens antithesis all through the script Who gets the better of it in the Heavenly Chorusbacked synthesis depends on your point of view Other than that D  B boasts a good performances by Peck  especially in the closing repentance scene and by Jayne Meadows as his bitter first wife Michol vivid moody atmosphere good idea to set most action at dawn or night and the rousing rendition of the TwentyThird Psalm at the end
0,I spotted the DVD on a store near my home and since Im a cheesy horror moviealien flicks addict I wondered how good it was It even had two award mentions on the cover I dont remember what festival it won so I figured Hey this might be good So I bought it for five euros and I came here to IMDb to check out some reviews Here either people bashed the movie to say it was bad or people said the movie was a wonderful feat in indie movies bla bla I then played the DVD not thinking about any review I had read with an open mind and not expecting anything at all Man I dont like being this critical but the movie was genuinely bad OK Im just going to give out some pointers of what I thought 1Actingdialog The acting was so confusing sometimes the actors did a decent job but there were scenes were I could spot no effort at all from them The dialog was even worst I think it was probably the aspect I most disliked in the whole movie The talking in between characters seemed off Not just bad but far away from the actual happenings in the movie The monologues of the female character although well delivered became boring and annoying in a little while But of course the most ridiculous aspect was the aliens or the infected I wont even comment on that one just going to say that it was absolutely ridiculous and took the entire mood away from the picture 2Visuals the strongest aspect in the movie if you forget the awful FX and light flashes they used to simulate explosions or what the hell they were supposed to be The camera in car aspect was quite cool actually but they didnt even used the environment to inspire fear or dread They left that to cheap sound and video FX and the three infected characters The movie becomes boring in so many scenes 3Sound Talk about editing this movie has no problems in showing how weakly edited it was From computer sounds imitating the forest animals to the alien dialog ah So what did I like in the movie SPOILERS the only thing I really liked and it was actually quite scary was the succession of two scenes where the car is still and you spot somethingsomeone walking in a distant At first I really thought it was me seeing things but when the character realizes that the figures coming towards her were her own reflection I was surprised Pretty creepy idea done well Apart from that I had an awful time And I dont recommend this to anyone not even teen get together because you cant even laugh at this I give it a solid 2 Only some technical achievements worked here apart from that yeah nothing
1,James J Corbett heavyweight champion of the world from 1892 to 1897 turned out to be Errol Flynns favorite role Possibly because he didnt have to wield a sword or be in a western He grew tired of the swashbucklers and he said in his autobiography that he felt he was miscast in westerns and couldnt understand why people liked him in them It is an enjoyable film but hardly does tell the real story of James J Corbett As portrayed Corbett was the first scientific boxer to win in the heavyweight division a man who used brains and speed more than brute strength to win He defeated John L Sullivan and lost to Bob Fitzsimmons the heavyweight crown He was also a compulsive womanizer and in that was a lot like the man portraying him Of course that was not shown on the screen The character that Alexis Smith plays the bankers daughter who falls for him has no basis in reality Corbett was in fact married twice and was flagrantly unfaithful with both of his wives Also though after he lost his title and after the events of this film are concluded he suffered a great personal tragedy His father in a moment of depression probably over finances because he lost heavily betting on his son to beat Bob Fitzsimmons shot his mother and then turned the gun on himself The murdersuicide hardly squares with the happy clan that Alan Hale presided over One thing though that I did like about Gentleman Jim Ward Bond got the career role of his life in playing John L Sullivan Director Raoul Walsh got a great performance out of Bond as the blustering but lovable Sullivan Even given some of Sullivans bad points that dont make it to the screen like rabid racism Bonds portrayal is the quintessential John L and the best thing about Gentleman Jim Speaking of racism one thing that should have been told was the fact that Sullivan while champion refused on grounds of race to meet Peter Jackson who was black and from Australia and probably the best heavyweight of his time I say probably because as a challenger Corbett met him and fought him for 61 rounds to a draw That fight more than any other created a demand for a SullivanCorbett title match Of course when Corbett was champion he refused to give Jackson a title shot Maybe he didnt want another 61 round marathon with someone who may have been better on that particular day Gentleman Jim is not Jim Corbetts story it is a movie of Errol Flynn playing at being James J Corbett But Corbett had he been alive in 1942 no doubt would have loved the movie and loved Flynns portrayal of his life Its as he would have liked to have been remembered
1,This is one great show that it makes me wonder why it got pulled off the air so many times But I believe its now here to stay This show cant compare to any other Before Simpsons was pretty on the edge and than came Family Guy and they are stretching it out to go off the edge The things this show gets away with is incredible Totally work the watch If you like the Simpsons you will LOVE Family guy
1,I have heard an awful lot about The English Patient and I finally decided to get the CD and find out what all the ballyhoo was about What I found out was a cinematic delight and should I repeat should always be watched with an open mind If you are a religious moral zealot I am afraid this is not a film for you as you will fail to see the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece as you will keep on harping on the moral dilemmas this film creates As I remember correctly before I watched this film I read the review in this site and was thoroughly disgusted by the views of that person who I quote said that the protagonists thoroughly deserved what they got When it comes to morality I agree with him but this is not the way to comment on a film of this magnificence  I must admit rarely have I seen such a wonderfully crafted film I keep on hearing the background soundtrack in my subconscious First and foremost this is a love story and yes its an extramarital affair moralists beware but lets not keep focusing on that Instead lets focus on how the story was told Its an admixture of flashbacks and the present Its set in the world war II and tells us the story of a survivor of a plane crash Count Almazhy played wonderfully by Ralph Fiennes who is looked after by an army nurse Juliet Binoche in war torn Italy just before the beginning of the end defeat of the axis powers The burn scarred patient very much in pain kept on remembering the torrid affair he had with an English woman Katherine Kristin Scott Thomas shown in flashbacks set in prewar Africa The past and the present are interwoven so adroitly in the story that youre sort of transported in the story and get the feel of a first hand viewer The locales in the desert and in Italy are beautiful and so are the characters I am a romantic and am not ashamed to say I had tears after it ended Watch it with someone you truly love The movie starts and ends with the same shot of the desert where the sand dunes twist and curves like a womans body and it was breathtaking The sense of loss and grief was conveyed so overwhelmingly by the actors that it makes me wonder why god Why do we have wars that destroys beauty and the most unforgivable of all the destruction of Innocence  Anyway it deservedly won a bunch of Oscars and I will go hunting for other works of director Anthony MinghellaIt kind of brings back the romanticism in the David Lean genre of filmsIt almost reminds me of Lawrence of Arabia which was also based in the desertHappy viewing folks
0,Yes its pure trash It might be interesting for every guy who likes experimental cinema like me to see lowlifes babbling and doing nothing for almost two hours but it gets very painful when you realize you have actually paid for this Probably this is one of those films you love to watch for its complete emptiness and nihilism I accept it though for its shock value decades before Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction
0,This movie downshifts from 4th into 1st without bothering with 3rd or 2nd grinding gears all the way to the sappy bmovie finishline The con at the beginning is easily the best and cleverest part of the movie That is worth seeing The scene with Harlow in the bathtub occurs so fast you may miss it Definitely not worth all the ballyhoo provided by Robert Osborne in his TCM intro to this badtomediocre confusion There is no real conflict and all of the characters in this supposed fringe society turn out to be saints  especially the unbelievable character Al I wonder if hes got a job for me in Cincinnati
1,Im really addicted to Caprica because its a really good prequel series to Battlestar Galactica It really has a slow pace start but surely to pick up soon after new episodes continue to air I have heard great things about future episodes and guest stars for the first season This Sci Fi drama is sure to please us fans who love a mix of both genres Eric Stoltz does an amazing job as well as Polly Walker as Clarice Willow Totally worth checking out Catch Caprica On Fridays At 9pm8pm central on SYFY
1,If any style of film could be called my guilty pleasure itd be this generic fantasy type Guilty is the wrong word for it though as Im pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time Stardust is good stock fantasy the likes of which one should expect from Neil Gaiman or Gaiman adaptation as it were It isnt the visual dreamscape of Mirrormask it isnt the adult pretension of Pans Labyrinth and it isnt the funloving classic The Princess Bride but it contains just what the fantasylover is familiarized enough with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing Fantasy lovers should rejoicespecial effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough that this stuff is in regular production now The story of Stardust involves a young man named Tristan who in order to gain the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town of Wall goes on an adventure to retrieve a fallen star To make things difficult however Tristans fallen star is actually a woman named Yvaine and hes not the only one looking for her some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the stars heart can give and a brothers feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her direction From there its all pretty predictable but it involves some attractive fantasy elements some warmhearted commentary on the nature of love and the best part Robert DeNiro as a gay pirate On that note DeNiros performance is spoton its not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a roughandgruff typecast character thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching DeNiros own opening up into alternate forms of acting DeNiro hasnt been so unique to his own image since Brazil and thats saying something Stardust is the type of movie perhaps that will subsist on childrens and fantasylovers shelves for a long time I cant say it offers anything new but its not really there to Its actually those most familiar with its tropes that will enjoy it the most PolarisDiB
1,Oh yes Hollywood does remember how to use the good old formula and when lightning hits its a rather wonderful feeling Rarely Hollywood creates a masterpiece because lately there seems to be more concern with hurrying up and getting the most rewards in a hurried manner or there is the matter of too many cooks in the mix Usually good screenplays are the result of a talented writer who is in full control of hisher property understand his material and is a good writer Then there is a little important part often neglected by the marketing geniuses that so often lack creativity and vision a good actor A good actor can make the difference between a mediocre halfcooked try and a fully realized film that might not be an important and relevant movie but one that contributes to its genre and might eventually become a classic of its type We get very few romantic comedies and we are people who are starved for them Buried in the sexy humor of Sex in the City is the romantic yet stormy relationship of Big and Carrie and people flocked to Mamma Mia because it had some romance skillfully played by Streep and Brossnam It could have a silly musical but it did touch us because it was played with intensity and conviction Nights offers us more of it with the amazing talents of a woman who does magnificent work in romantic films Ms Diane Lane Ever since her days as a child actor we could appreciate how her talent combined with her appreciative soul allowed us to see into the hearts of the storys protagonists A few years back she teamed up with Mr Gere giving us a tormented romantic and sexy performance as the wife who is not too sure of her actions consequences in Unfaithful work that should have garnered her at least an Academy Award She is back doing more formidable work in this romantic gem as a woman who has given up on her romantic prospects and suddenly she realizes there might be another chance around the corner Ms Lane makes this film pulsate with intelligence and passion Her facial expressions communicate volumes about the different emotions her character undergoes We can read frustrations yearnings desperation anger hope loss and a range that is way out reach for a lot of the marketable types that Hollywood constantly push down our throats Here is a mature performer who has the gift to project real emotions and allows us to connect with the material in such a way that we are moved as we become part of the experience Ms Lane is such a triumphant joy to watch as she goes through transformations from the first scenes of the film until the very end Her discoveries become ours as we celebrate with her the power of hope and love She is able to bring back the unsurpassed joy of a person in love much like a teenager does and yet she never lets you think of her character as silly or irresponsible Her eyes are expressive gems that can move even the cynical in the audience She is one of the stars that can do wonders with just one look In her the classic feel of those grand movies of yesterday are back Her work recalls the passionate and intelligent work of Hepburn Davis Garson women who played everyday types and made them memorable because they created complete characters We admire those superb actresses who recreate real life legends and are rewarded for it Half their work is done by the mystique of the figures they impersonate however as much as anyone might make you think it is the roles such as Lanes in this movie that are a more impressive achievement because they are created from scratch given a personal imprint and are able achieve heights without any previous theatrical material support such as plays and the background of a famous legend whose life is paid tribute on the silver screen Lanes character is one woman whose experiences could be any of us She represents our dreams and emotions with much quality class and just the right amount of sentiment It is quite a remarkable achievement and we should be grateful that we are still able to find such a remarkable performance nowadays There are a few adjectives I could use to pay tribute to her work but I can only say that in my humble opinion every single frame of her work in this film is testament to one of the greatest performances ever put on celluloid by a living performer Thank you Ms Lane
0,By the numbers story of the Kid Prince a singer on his way to becoming a star Then he falls in love with Apollonia Appolonia Kotero But he has to deal with his wifebeating father Clarence Williams III and his own selfdestructive behavior I saw this in a theatre in 1984 I was no big fan of Prince but I did like the three big songs from this moviePurple Rain Lets Get Crazy and When Doves Cry The concert scenes in this movie are greatfull of energy and excitement Unfortunately thats a VERY small portion of the movie The story is screamingly obvious and have been done many times beforeand much better too The subplots are to put in nicely badly handled The love triangle between The Kid Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and tired that I actually became insulted His wife beating father is needed for the story but the scenes are so badly handled in acting and direction that I couldnt believe it The script is terriblelousy dialogue and some truly painful comedy routines And theres tons of misogyny hereThe Kids mother getting beaten The Kid hitting Appolonia and for no reason Appolonia strips and goes topless to swim in a dirty river Also Williams and Princes characters treat women in a horrible manner constantly The acting is where this movie REALLY fails Appolonia is sweet and beautifulbut no actor And Prince is easily the WORST actor Ive ever seen His blank face and wooden dialogue delivery are so bad I couldnt believe it This movie only comes to life during the concert scenes but there arent really that many The dramatic scenes are so badly acted and handled that they make this movie a chore to sit through They should have just made this a concert film I give this a 2only for the music
1,I thought The River of Souls was a very good Babylon 5 movie with some exceptional performances from Martin Sheen Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane If this were an episode of the series without the humour it would probably be one of my favourite standalone stories of the series Personally Ive always preferred Scoggins to Christian although granted JMS didnt write her as well for much of the series and she did have to endure the ByronTelepath plot If you take out the smutty humour about the brothel and the poorer actors in those scenes then this movie is solid stuff Probably my third favourite of the four movies but in no means bad at all
1,Just saw it at as closing film of Austin Film Festival Going in a had seen a few snippets of their act at Alamo Drafthouse and thought the trailer was amusing but I wasnt expecting such an epic theme music and the use of tarot cards is genius in the title sequence Watch out for cameos from Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins and the dark lord himself who has a fetish for KG So much overthetop fun and the songs are so catchy The car chase was by far my favorite scene I know this will earn cult status right away and win over some new Tenacious D fans just like me I hope this does well in the theaters Follow me we are the shadows
0,One of the five worst movies I have ever watched And Im not exaggerating In fact I recommend watching it so you can get the same feeling of incredulity as you might by watching Showgirls Out of 400 votes the movie gets a user rating of 5310 But there is a disproportionate number of voters who gave it a 1010 probably due to the message of the movie  nuclear weapons are the bane of mankind Chuck Murdock is an allstar little league pitcher who gives up baseball because there are nuclear weapons Soon Amazing Grace Smith is an allstar Boston Celtic who is inspired by Chucks story and gives up basketball Soon all sports leagues from the professional level to college to high school to little league dismantle in a worldwide protest Later all the children of the world go on a silence strike This inspires the President of the United States to meet with the Soviet Premier who in time agree to eliminate all nuclear weapons in time for the start of the next Little League season The movie ends with Chuck about to throw out the first pitch with the President telling his new best friend Chuck not to worry about striking out every batter as he hasnt thrown a baseball in a year Somewhere along the line a nefarious underworld boss kills Amazing Grace When the President finds out he is told that the FBI can verify the killer but will never be able to prove it So the President calls the underworld boss But its one am I dont care get him on the line and tell him that he is to resign from all company boards that he sits on and sell all stocks that he has And to not get out of line again Honestly this movie was so crappy that I couldnt turn it off It was on television from 230 am to 400 am and I watched it all I wasnt turned off by the antinuclear weapons propaganda I was turned off by the implausible break down of all organized sports I dont even understand why Amazing Grace Smith was killed And with all these famous athletes becoming Chucks friends why the father was constantly upset with his son taking a principled stand And there was the clichÃ© moment near the end when dad tells Chuck I never told you this but Im proud of you Cue hug
0,We have given this film one star for awful however it really depends on how you look at it We are currently watching this on Channel 5 at 330am and we havent stopped laughing so perhaps we could give it a 10 just for the entertainment value Right from the outset with the manic thoughts of the stalker being relayed in comic fashion we were laughing Is it me or does that chick from Knotts Landing look like one of the characters from the Dark Crystal Im not going to spoil it for you however you would have to be pretty stupid not to see it coming i dont think its clever enough for double bluffs This has to be the worstbest film we have ever seen if wed been playing the spot the clichÃ© drinking game then we be wasted by now
1,A dark and painful look at the perils of drug addiction Sinatra is wonderful in this film Just watching his frenzied writhing and screaming and destructive rage near the end of the film is enough to make anyone think twice about trying heroin maybe they should show this to kids in health class instead of the mindless drivel we are compelled to endure year after year Its the story of a man who is simply trying to make a new clean life for himself after being in prison trying to rid himself of his drug habit and his job of dealing cards in illegal gambling operations who is pulled down pulled back into the muck by the evils of human nature He is being taken advantage of by his employers the drug dealers and even his enigmatic craftyyetstupid wife  Even if you didnt like the film itself its worth seeing just for the soundtrack Its all heavy swinging jazz with large drum and brass sections This with its groovy yet slightly sinister sound helps set the mood along with the grinning snaky drug and card dealers who always seem to hover like vultures around Frankie Machine I recommend this to anyone  especially if you like film noir zoot suits fedoras or jazz
0,Carlos Mencia continually violently hatefully screaming Bch at women is like screaming Nger at black people except its worse Remember the B word unlike the N word is the only pejorative term that is still associated on a daily basis with violence Bch is the last thing women hear before they are raped beaten or murdered This guy is perpetuating violence by hatefully using the language of violence Sounds like he may be a gay guy trying to cover by womanbashing so that he will sound like a hetero And how about all the Nazi white guys in his audience giving the fascist salutes while their stupid little bimbo white women whimper tee hee hee at their side clearly terrified to protest this tidal wave of womanhating Tee hee hee Bet Mencia doesnt believe or support free speech for THEM Come on Carlos Â– do you want women to have the free speech to bchslap you as loudly and violently and bigmouthed as you do or do you think free speech is only for men to crap on women
0,But I cant say how I really feel about this pile of steaming dung Where to begin The film quality there isnt any Ive seen clearer pictures on Americas FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS The acting is substandard the gore effects is okay The clown mask is the best part of this movie the story is repetitive The same thing over and over again At least in a Friday THE 13TH or HALLOWEEN we stick with one main character for the most part There is no main characters just victims Man now we come to the worst part of all The final survivor kills the clown and finds out it was one of her friends Then when the police finally arrive they dont believe her and she is locked up in a rubber room What kind of ending do you call that crap thats what In my opinion there is no excuse for a bad ending in a horror movie that was just sloppy writing The excuse It has to ending badly its a horror movie or We need to end it badly to leave it open to a sequel are just lame excuses and that is all I must give the CAMP BLOOD the THANKSGIVING TURKEY
1,Its true that this is not realistic story but romantic comedy is not a genre that I look to for realism What counts is that the characters are likeable and as needed sexy Shalom is beautiful and relaxed and Jake Weber is handsome in an offhand kind of way They have enough chemistry to make the story believable in the area that counts sexual attraction I would love to see either of them in another movie And yes the clown is pretty cute too
0,Chupacabra Terror 210 It was the Navy Seal team that tipped the balance from bad cheesy movie to just bad Up till then there was a lot of bad movie baggage but the SealsÂ… They are wearing bicycle helmets painted black You know the ones with air holes that make every adult who wears them look like a complete tool Of course the bass fishing boat they took to greet the cruise ship might have been another clue it wouldnt make it across Tampa Bay let alone an oceanÂ… and their tactics wouldnt pass muster on an 3rd rate XBOX game Does director John Shepphird have photos of John RhysDavies in a compromising position with a Hobbit Because I cant think of any other reason he would be in this movie The other actors have a great excuse They are talentless unattractive hacks that couldnt get hired for an infomercial The plot is that two men try to smuggle the mythical Chupacabra Love saying that name aboard a cruise ship and it gets loose The sets consist of horrible cruise ship fakery complete with airshafts the size of a small apartment the monster killings are bottom of the barrel there is no nudity and a lot of really bad actors refuse to finish their death scenes Of particular annoyance is a gigolo character from a 60s Doris Day movie The cast bleeds ketchup while the Chupacabra bleeds day green glow in the dark blood Why a goat eating Mexican mammal would bleed anything but red is beyond me Every B movie has a tipping point that makes it a fun time Hey its a lesbian shower scene OMG that guy just ate is own eyeballs or not so fun Did they just call those forty something overweight guys wearing coveralls and bicycle helmets Navy Seals Chupacabra falls into the not so fun B movie side with a thud
1,LE CERCLE ROUGE is a very good film though it does suffer a bit since there have already been similar films In all too many ways the movie is reminiscent of previous heist films such as RIFIFI and GRAND SLAM and many others So while director Melville and the actors did great jobs it all seems like a case of DÃ©jÃ  vu Because of this I had a hard time giving this excellent film a higher score The one unusual aspect of the film is how the crooks get together Instead of the usual means Vogel escapes from prison and just happens to meet up with Corey a career criminal just released from prison Both are a good match but having them both work in parallel for much of the film until they meet was a clever touch Apart from that as expected much of the movie concerns the meticulous details in planning and executing the crime I also appreciated how the film showed the crooks in such a cold and detached mannersomething relatively common in French crime films but rare among American films until recent years Overall extremely wellcrafted and worth seeingif you dont mind that it seems a tad repetitive youll see some fine acting direction and a lot of great tension
0,And the title says it all a cheesy sounding title that is a cheesy sounding joke of a film known as Alien from LA Why not just call it Alien from South Africa as this is the place where this movie was filmed My advice for watching movies that have been featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000 do not watch the original version of the movie at all Period Always watch the movie with the theater shadow at the bottom of the screen with a man trapped in space with his two funny wisecracking robot friends sitting at the lower right hand corner of the screen It just seems better that way Movie as it was originally seen Awful Movie as it was seen on MST3K Genius
0,When I saw this at a shop I thought it looked really good and original Like Wolfs Creek meets Texas chainsaw massacre and I mean it only cost three quid around 6 To be honest I dont think it was even worth that It seemed like the directors the butcher brothers couldnt decide whether wanted to do a artsy sort of horror or a gory slasher horror It ended up with a clichÃ© ridden gory sadistic hour and fifteen minutes with all the characters being one dimensional and you couldnt care less what happened to them but to try to make the audience care about the characters they added a useless monologue at the end and the beginning of the film which to be perfectly honest wasnt needed The only good part really was the middleend I wont ruin it for you But that was the only good part Overall a pointless watch It felt like a two hour film but was in fact only 75 minutes If you want an artsy filmdont bother If you want a slasher movie dont bother The film moves so slowly with nothing ever happening
1,I own all family guy seasons so far and i have to say Vol 6 has been the biggest disappoint of them all There are still plenty of laughs to be found here but i think Vol 6 like the last few volumes is slowly providing less and less laughs At least for me The biggest annoyance i had with Vol 6 is it seems to be VERY heavy in left wing politics Im a big believer in if you can laugh at other people you should be able to laugh at yourself but this Volume REALLY seems to shove their political view points down your throat and i think it takes a lot away from the show Insinuated all conservative sates are horrible places Insinuating we need more gun control Insinuated school are under funded Insinuated religious people are crazy Bush is friends with the devil I could go on and this is just from the first three episodes Sure some of it was funny but there becomes a point when youre not making a comedy and youre really just shoving your political views on other people

1,CONTAINS SPOILERS I saw an advert for this on a videoThen my sister discovered that we had the book so I read itI rented the video on the same day I finished the bookI thought it was very memorable as was the book The cast was brilliantTara Fitzgerald was excellent as Helen and Rupert Graves was hateful as ArthurThe costumesmusic and settings are stunningly beautiful WARNINGDONT READ ANY MORE IF YOU HAVENT WATCHED THIS On the downside there are some sex scenes that have been added in and some violenceThis is why the video is rated 15 There are some other things that have been thrown inAfter the first partI felt that the accuracy went downhill While the book is better than thisI am glad I have seen it and would reccomend it to people who have read the bookare fans of Bronte or like costume dramasI am all 3as long as you fastforward through the sex scenes The book is rather underatedAnne Brontes books dont seem to be that widely read or well known as Jane Erye or Wuthering Heights which have made it into television and film several times Another thingWhen I read the book I was surprised at how much religion ther was in itbut here they had axed that all out 7\10
1,There are several ways to misunderstand this movie and a couple of them have been shown in some of the past comments This is a movie to be analyzed as a free recreation of a known subject and therefore not to be compared with the opera the book or other Carmen movies seen before It just stands for itself and I must say that this Carmen does it very well It is a mistake to compare because that is the first step to deny movies the chance to be autonomous creative works of art Vicente Aranda is a master of atmosphere and the art direction the costumes and the photography are extremely well put together to achieve a pleasing aesthetic experience Lets take it as it is And that brings us to the next misunderstanding Someone complains about the typical Spanish clichÃ©s in the movie Well historically the movie is extremely well researched and you can see the results of that very serious work in every scene It is not only an accurate portrait of the black Spain of knife and espadrille that Goya portrayed so vividly but its also of that part of history as seen by a foreigner fascinated with the folkloric side of that society Honestly anyone who doesnt want to see any clichÃ© about Spain shouldnt buy a ticket to see Carmen but in this case those clichÃ©s are presented before they became one and the way to see them is getting rid of our own prejudices Another important requirement to understand this movie properly is to speak the language It is not acceptable to criticize any actor performance for not having understood his or her lines If all the rest of the audience did the problem most likely lies somewhere else Paz Vega has an immaculate diction with her Andalusian accent and all she says is understandable and credible Her Argentinian partner Leonardo Sbaraglia gives also a convincing portrait of the Basque officer that became a bandolero and her accent is very well learned No less important is to have a minimally open approach to the material To say that Paz Vega is horrible suggests that the author of the phrase entered the theater for the wrong reasons We already had in Spain a critic in one of the most prestigious papers that used to recommend us pictures he found homosexually arousing without mentioning it explicitly And that was not totally fair for the rest of us especially for the ones that hadnt detected that the man was writing with parts of his anatomy that many readers didnt necessarily had to care for Im not suggesting at all that the reviewer had the same motivation but the expectations must have been different as the ones of those among us that went to see a talented and beautiful actress play an almost classic role because thats what we got Paz Vega IS Carmen and an excellent one in Vicente Arandas movie
0,I had to read I Know Why The Caged Birds Sing in my English class and we watched the movie after finishing it After watching the movie I regret seeing It completely took away any of the impact the book had The scenes made no sense in their sequences the acting was horrible and it seemed as though the screen writer never actually picked up the book but opted for the cliff notes instead I was outraged at how the movie ended Almost half of the book was cut out and certain aspects were extremely important to Mayas growth as a person If you have read Caged Birds this movie will ruin the experience of the book so I warn you not to see it
1,PAGE 3  out of 4 Stars Madhvi Konkona Sen enters her boyfriends house and its empty She looks here and there and then goes in his bedroom and you get the picture  Ah another girl Â… that twotiming baddie and yes indeed he his two timing her but its a GUY this time around And i say Brilliant END OF SPOILERS The above scene is not a spoiler really  but for me it was so i didnt want to take a chance When asked upon as how was this film my friend answered oh it just an exposÃ© of the P3 people which made me believe that ill be watching a stupid movie if nothing more When I went to the theater I thought to myself  I better get a pen and a paper to jot down the bad things about this film but I was proved entirely wrongÂ… and then some because I could muster only the goods This film was great Great not because it is offbeat and noncommercial cinema like storyline but because of the cleverness in the screenplay and how this movie tells you how to handle a movie brilliantly which could have been a dumb and senseless movie if given in the wrong hands Konkona Sen Sharma is grace She is so damn beautiful who has nailed her role perfectly as if she was born to play this part One of the most charming actresses Ive ever seen But this is not the only performance which is good in the film theres Sandhya Mridul Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni Particularly Sandhya Mridul who just fires up the screen And guess what even the unusually accented Tara Sharma speaks normally The movies stars off with some silly old parties of the hushhush celebrities of the film industry et al and you get the idea of what this movie will be about And for about half hour through the film you feel just about the same But then the movie picks up the pace grabs onto a good storyline and never lets go of it Even Boman Irani agrees to that statement Â– It was a good story Madhvi Thank you The great thing is that it tackles the issue of how silly these people are with style and does not make it over done and also tackles the social issues and does not make them boring In the end its all a rollercoaster ride and Madhvi informs us that by just smiling at all these people Just the reason why I love watching films Ecstatic filmmaking The screenplay is beautiful clever and witty
1,Ive read a lot of comments about the film and how its so hard for people to believe that it is a sequel to Henry Fool and even though it technically is I think that Fay Grim needs to be looked at as an entirely different film Just because it is the sequel doesnt mean that it has to be a direct continuation of the first and I enjoyed that so much about it The whole point of the film was to change direction from the first which makes sense because the movie isnt called Henry Fool 2 its Fay Grim All that aside the film I thought was so well made and thought out that it actually surprised me I was expecting to rent another nearlyreleasedstraighttovideo film and have to endure 2 hours of bad editing and an almost hard to follow storyline aka parkers last direct to video feature the Oh in Ohio but this was so surprisingly well focused that it almost doesnt seem so which I absolutely loved There are so many nuances in the film making and writing that I crave to see in films but never do The cinematography was brilliant due to its simplicity and truly making the film seem Grim throughout  in terms of setting The writing was so well put together as well whoever said this movie isnt as witty as Henry Fool needs to watch again and actually listen I almost cant even begin to explain how actually hilarious it was and pertinent And well Parker Posey who could complain The scene in which Fool and Jalal were talking in the dark was so captivating and emotional And I thought the spyness throughout the film was just so hilarious and spot on in hindsight because i do agree that at times during you kind of felt lost The main thing that struck me so powerfully about the film and i believe the point of the film was Parkers love and naivety about Fool which was so endearing and turned yes very quickly from denial to outright passion The last five minutes of the film were perfect Obviously there were things that werent excellent but nothing is perfect some of the acting was poor and at times I did think that some of the new back story and dialogue about terrorism got a little hard to follow and out of hand but in the end you got it and didnt even mind that at the time it may have slipped from your comprehension This may also have to do with Goldblums tendency to talk extremely fast On the whole I would say that it was probably one of the best films Ive seen this year stylistically pleasing clever and witty writing performances that were so impressive I now have gained new respect for some of the actors and a truly touching film and dont forget a complete departure from Fool Which was the point
0,Considering the limits of this film The entire movie in one setting  a music studio  only about 5 or 6 actors total it should have been much better made IF you have these limits in making a film how could the lighting be so bad And the actors were terrible were talking a hair below the acting in Clerks except that was an enjoyable movie this had no substance Well it tried to but really fails It makes attempt to be selfreferencing in a couple parts but the lines were delivered so poorly by the actors it was just bad And the main character Neal guy what a pathetic looser Clearly like 10 people total made this film and they all knew each other and it probably was a real rock band that they had but unfortuntly these people really have no idea how terrible they are all around This was made in 2005 but they all look so naieve it smacks of just pregrunge era Thankfully I didnt pay to see this Starz on Demand delivers again but it was under the title The Possessed not Studio 666 it doesnt matter what you do to the title it cant help this This could have been a much better made movie  there is no excuse for this bad filmmaking when you have the obvious limited parameters the filmmakers had when they made this working within those limits you should make the stuff you can control and the stuff you can work with the best you can Instead they figured mediocrity would be good enough And that music video wow that was bad I fast fowarded through that So 210 is fair if you are into the whole bmovie crap I suppose youll go and see this
1,Eight Simple rules started as a very entertaining series I love John Ritter and his character Paul Hennessey and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the show I have always preferred Kerry to Bridget Bridget has been done before Kerry is quite unique and i can relate to her in many ways although im not sure i like the direction her character went in later series Early episodes were fun good simple teenage plots about Paul and Cate disciplining the kids however i think the show lost its sparkle when John Ritter died I admired the cast and crew for wishing to continue the series but when he died i felt the programme did to To me the whole point of the show was based around the guide of the 8 simple rules of dating my teenage daughter it was written by a real man with teenage daughters and the relevance and the angle of the show had changed without the Hennessey dad Bridget seemed to get more annoying Rory stayed the same and Cate was always giving her offspring lifes lessons which before seemed funnier when it was all left to Paul I think the Granddad is funny Especially when hes watching Great escape but feel CJ is unnecessary to the show He is funny in parts but I felt the story lines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other American comedy series Over all the newer ones arent bad just missing excitement and does anyone else find it irritating that Cate works at the school and CJ and Granddads always there too I would always recommend this show to friends as it was very strong at the beginning and well worth watching for Paul and Kerry but later ones were about average at best
1,My husband and I watched this last nightIt was wonderfulFor once he was wrong in guessing ahead of time the suspenseful ending It moved along very quickly and the acting was superb I adore Tom Wilkinson anyway He has never made a bad movie as far as Im concerned The above description of his acting hits the nail on the head The facial expressions are incredible Even the picturesque scenery is awesome We have just finished watched all of the Prime Suspect series and I am convinced that the British have a way of capturing the audience There is no doubt that I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get a few hours of thorough entertainment
0,If this film had a budget of 20 million Id just like to know where the money went A monkey could make better CGI effects then what was wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of garbage although I must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really really cool on an original playstation 1 game and early PC games from the mid 90s if a game had ever been made What puzzles me is where did the money go Pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la George Lucas circa 197583 and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing or ruining in this case for about the same 20 million This is quite possibly the worst film EVER made I would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of Ishtar than watch this film again I hated it completely I regress I say this IS the WORST film EVER made because unlike other bad movies like Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes or Santa Claus Conquers the Martians these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them you love them There is no love for this film and no place in my DVD library for it I sold it to a guy for a dollar Im betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew Shame on you Pendragon films I want my money back
1,This is one of the funniest shows on TV today It hits the mark 99 of the time Usually after watching a sitcom after a few years the actors become to cartoonish as if they are trying to become the beloved characters they play These actors have in my opinion stayed true to their roles The chemistry is still there the writing has not gone down and I still look forward to watching it The family dynamic still seems real and the situations after all this time are not so far fetched to make it seem the writers are reaching into an empty bag trying to keep the show on for one more season It is one of the few shows I watch without the remote in my hand for quick switching
1,Just watched it on the Hallmark Channel I was surprised to John Denver This movie was full of clichÃ©s but that is to be expected a made for TV Christmas movie come on The acting is as good as any other 80s made for TV movie The story is as I said before predictable and clichÃ© but still good If you are looking for a campy Christmas movie it will certainly scratch your itch I was also pleased when I learned that it took place in Georgetown Colorado It is a real mountain town west of Denver Very cool as this is my home region I was never a big John Denver fan I always found him to be pretty foney but he was a decent actor He is very good as the good old boy like he played in this film If you get the chance to watch it than do Im sure it will be on again in 2007
1,One of the greatest movies to come out of the 80s Dirty Dancing was a lowbudget film with highbudget returns With a soundtrack that makes you want to get up and dance to a love story that all of us wish we could live at least if youre female this is a movie that you will want to watch over and over again The music which is what drives the movie is upbeat and flows well with the emotions which are drawn from the viewer From classic 60s hits like Love Man by Otis Redding and Big Girls Dont Cry by Frankie Valli to pure 80s hits like Eric Carmens Hungry Eyes and Frank Zappacostas Overload Dirty Dancing is a mix of fun and sensual showing the transformation of a young girl from shy teenager into a blossoming womanhood all against the beautiful backdrop of a summer romance that we all hope and wish turned into more The dancing in Dirty Dancing is not to be forgotten Cynthia Rhodes shines in her role as Penny a dancer who could challenge even the most fluid and lithe gymnasts Patrick Swayze does more than a fantastic job and shows off more and more of his skills not just as an actor but dancer and singer as well And Jennifer Grey shines as Baby while her transformation in dancing portrays her transformation in status as well All in all Dirty Dancing is one of the best movies of all time and well worth watching at least once Its doubtful that the first beats of the Ronettes Be My Baby in the opening title wont snare your attention and draw you in to a magical world of sensual dance and musical enchantment
1,I dont really know what it is about Dirty Dancing there is some sort of absolute magic in this movie I cannot possibly recount the hundreds yes hundredsof times Ive watched it beginning to end but every time I do come upon it on TV I am entranced and mystified and sit myself down and there I am for two hours loving the movie as if Im watching it for the first time Although Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey absolutely hated each other throughout the making of this film they possess a beautiful chemistry on the set it makes the viewer enjoy it that much more to see this passion and commitment and I cant help tearing up a tiny bit at the end when Patrick comes up to the Houseman family and tells her dad Nobody puts Baby in a corner classic moment For all those people who believe this movie is corny and sappy maybe in a way it is but it was the penicle of the 80s films and put Patrick Swayze right on the map his performance was immaculate  Three Cheers for Dirty Dancing  Ps The soundtrack is fantastic an absolute masterpiece
0,Scientists at a remote lab experiment on insert scaly creature here and create out of control monsters In the meantime a crack military teamthe scientists daughterbank robbers find their way to the remote place and are menaced by the giant critters One by one theyre eaten all during an exciting race to not be blown up by the forces who initially created the monsters The sad thing is that this sounds like about a dozen movies which have appeared on the SciFi Channel I have to wonder just what is going on Sure I like bimbos and HollywoodHunk wannabes be eaten by CGI critters as much as the next person but wheres the plot or originality Granted there are times when SciFi Channel Shines Battlestar Galactica if a bit dark can be very good Writers have continued to pump life into the various Stargate offerings and the latest BBC import of Doctor Who is surprisingly good Even in the various giant animal movies on SciFi the animation seems to be getting better all the time Compare the kommodo in this film to the rather clunky version in the first giant kommodo film on SciFi But goodness how about a different plot Maybe some different giant critter On a whim I started searching around the internet Among the litter I found a few interesting stories which might appeal to SF fans and out of work Russian CGI animators at once I offer httpwwwmacrophilecomarilinarchivemetamorphosisday to the network with a suggestion that they contact the author for the story rights The story contains violent images generally on a par with those of various SciFi channel offerings The story has subplot ethical and moral comment on the nature of humanity and ends not on one of those horrible did they REALLY kill all the monsters moments but rather leaves you guessing completely and in an entirely different mindset Which is generally what sciencefiction is supposed to do no
0,Iowa wants to be Requiem for a Dream for Midwest meth but it comes across as a hard R rated Reefer Madness  Yes drugs are bad and meth is horribly pernicious as an addiction and how it destroys people families and communities But these characters who are either dumb or ridiculous and the eyerolling plot wont teach that lesson to anyone  While writerdirectorstar Matt Farnsworth has some charisma on screen his partner Diane Foster plays a wincibly silly wideeyed innocent corrupted by drugsas was already satirized by Susan Sarandon in The Rocky Horror Picture Show I really felt sorry for her for all the totally unnecessary nudity she was put through It wasnt until the end of the film that I realized I was supposed to think these two were recent highschool graduates to explain some of their naivetÃ© as we are bombarded by their school photos but if so they even looked older than the folks on The OC While they have good chemistry on screen they are a pale imitation of a Badlandstype couple  The guest stars are badly used Michael T Weiss who was so good in TVs The Pretender is completely ludicrous as a corrupt parole officer and his brutal violence is just plain crazy as his character pretty much ruins any social significance for the film Rosanna Arquette has to be even sleazier than she rolled around for David Cronenberg as a very low rent Livia Soprano John Savage even has to mouth the old baby boomer excuses about I did pot but this is worse A Goth chick shows up with the odd explanation that shes a stripper from Des Moines The obligatory Latino drug dealer appears  in Iowa  With a limited budget the interior view of meth use is portrayed quite vividly with quite scary hallucinations We certainly see them go crazy  While the Iowa locations are used very well including an amusing scene of a propane gas robbery the accents and church references are confusingly Southern Baptist Guns seem to be used by law abiding and law breaking citizens here more than in any innercity drugdealing movie The songs of Iowas best known bard Greg Brown are used throughout but oddly are not listed in the credits I hope they were used with permission I caught this at its commercial run in NYC because I missed it at the Tribeca Film Festival where it got considerable and inexplicable buzz
0,It is terrible It is like somebody gave a kid a faulty video camera and 30 and told them to make a film Even then youd get a better and more professional film than this The story is so dumb you can say there isnt one I dont think the guy who made this knew what to do at all  watching foreign art movies all day long isnt enough to make somebody an instant director The acting is very bad really kindergarten level and the writing is just plain awful The only scene I didnt hate was the one with the caravan accident but even that only means it was just slightly less horrible than the rest of the film How do people get finance for this stuff I dont mind alternative films but shouldnt they at least not be a big steaming pile of cow manure I would call Price of Milk amateurish if it wasnt an insult to amateurs This would not even be a good film if you were drunk or drugged
1,This review comes nearly 30 years late Nevertheless it has to be mentioned that I chanced by a copy of this movie sometime in early 2008 and watched it repeatedly for 4 months straight I just had to write about it I got smitten and forgot anything else existed once I saw this movie How ironic it is to see Literatures ugliest male protagonist portrayed by the handsomest man yet what a welcome irony It suited me perfectly and more so because Timothy Dalton did full justice to his role He delivered an astounding and triumphant performance I have never seen anything like it All the other actors are very good too The whole movie was put together beautifully I dont care what anyone says about this movie I just love it and love it It made me happy and satisfied It crushes me a bit to say this but I prefer Jane Eyre 1983 to AEs PJ which I believe is the ultimate miniseries  The excerpts from Jane Eyre spooked me a little back in school I never got around to reading the book seriously knowing the story line so well Seeing this particular production made the story come to life for me and drove me to a near frenzy The scenes and Mr Daltons voice haunted me endlessly and finally led me to read the book seriously which of course is a masterpiece Bravo to the whole team and especially to MrDalton This movie is now a part of me I give it 1010 rating
1,The Chipmunk Adventure is one of the greatest animated movies of the 1980s Alvin and the Chipmunks have always been of some interest to me since they were what really got me into rock and roll Neither one of the Chipmunks has any bad traits Alvins really the star and has all the cool looks Theodore is the lovable sensitive one Then theres Simon my personal favorite the smart one who is often a party pooper I also like the Chipettes a lot Theres Brittany who like Alvin is one who is always trying to be so popular Then theres Eleanor who like Theodore is sweet sensitive and loves food Janette is the only Chipette who is not much like her counterpart shes very naive and really clumsy In the Chipmunks very first fulllength movie David Seville is going on a business trip to Europe and hes leaving the boys with Miss Miller while hes gone While playing an arcade game Alvin loses against Brittany and then says that if he had the money hed race Brittany around the world for real Unbeknownest to the kids a man named Klaus Furschtien and his sister Claudia who have been trying to come up with a sneaky way to deliver diamonds around the world in exchange for cash overheard this conversation and said that theyd let them race around the world for 100000 Alvin and Brittany accept it and go on the race This adventurous movie has a lot of great songs Off to See the World made for an appropriate theme song for the movie Then there is Getting Lucky one of my favorite songs in the movie My Mother is most likely the sappiest song in the movie but it always makes me cry Wooly Bully is the only cover song used in the movie the rest were completely original Then of course theres The Boys and Girls of Rock and Roll which in my opinion has to be one of the greatest musical numbers in movie history I used to watch this movie very often until my recorded tape of it died I still watch the movie though This is actually a fun movie for people who are about to go on a vacation to a foreign country for the first time Itll give you an idea of what kind of stuff youd expect out of world travel Definitely one of my childhood movies and one that Id recommend to 80s fans and Alvin  the Chipmunks fans
1,Ive just revisited this fondly remembered bit of cinematic madness from my early days and must urge you to beg steal or borrow it The story begins with a duel between a righteous Shaolin priest and our villain Abbot White needless to say Abbot White kicks Buddhist ass and wages his campaign against Shaolin unhindered with the aid of his new ninja allies a golden clad one who fights with a gold ring a black clad one who fights with a spear and my favourite one who fights with a pair of knives who can disappear and reappear as a flying carpet The rest of the story concerns the training of the disciples of the Shaolin monks killed by Abbot white one of whom is Alexander Lo Rei Whilst we are treated to the punishing training sequences the two young avengers must go through to learn the Shaolin Finger Jab technique needed to defeat Abbot Whites invincible armour technique we see some of the ways our villain keeps in shapemostly using Taoist magic to extract the blood from naked ladies We all know how this is going to end but its the psychedelic trip in between that were here for In conclusion this is a good example of what Taiwan was doing when Hong Kong was getting sick of martial arts movies and that is making more and more outrageous martial arts movies This movie is very well choreographed has some nudity some gore and enough balls to the wall gimickry to keep even the most jaded viewer entertained Visit your local Beewise today 
1,It really is a shame that films like this never snag Best Picture nominations because this one is simply a winner This is by far the most consistently hilarious comedy I have ever seen Its screenplay and design are impeccable not to mention the incredible cast I can quote this movie for hours on end Watch it
1,This Film is the One which you fall in love with Alfred Hitchcock shall always remain over the top of any directors of his time The most influential aspects about his films are sheer Simplicity  Gripping Drama The another best thing about Hitchcocks films is a Definite  Gripping End Any thing said about The Man who knew too much is less The Cinematography Acting Dialogs  Camera Works are magnificent in this Movie The Song Que Sera Sera at the end shall remain in our memories for life time The film is so enjoyable from start to end that we never know when it ends Rarely would Hitchcock include humor in his films this film has comic scenes which fits in to the movie  This film is absolutely brilliant  as good as Vertigo
0,I am a student of film and have been for several years And the concept of a cyber kungfu satirical chimpanzee had me wondering Is this the film thats going to break the mold Lets face it America has never been let down by any piece of cinema that features a simian costar After such great classics as Monkey Trouble and Dunston Checks In I thought that the best ideas were already taken But then comes Funky Monkey I laughed I cried I contemplated suicide Now Ive read about demon possession in the Bible but that still doesnt explain why someone would create such a product of evil First off having at least a shred of intelligence I realized that a chimpanzee was in fact an ape not a monkey at all However I was sure that the filmmakers would clear this problem up further into the film They didnt Let me sum up this work of art A company by the name of ZIT has decided to train chimpanzees as soldiers Why I think they mention something about the soldiers working for bananas but when it would cost about an estimated 13 million dollars of government money to train one chimp this doesnt seem costeffective Well anyways ZIT brings in a CIA specialist Matthew Modine to train Clemens The Chimp Clemens is everything ZIT hoped for He can take out an entire shift of guards who all appear to have gotten their training skills at the local mall and yet still manage to remind us that were watching a kids movie As you may have guessed Modine finds out that ZITs intentions may be evil Gasp and decides to break Clemens out Being a CIA agent and all Modine knows that best way to make himself disappear is to go to a large city rent a guest room regularly make appearances on television while fighting crime and using checks to pay for everything ZIT finds out where Modine is staying and sends two of their finest to retrieve him These guards are possibly the greatest comedy team up since Martin and Lewis or was it Turner and Hooch It doesnt matter anyways because in the end for a heck of a twist ending the good guys win Yay Hooray for predictability Throw in a nerdy kid who learns to be himself a lonely mom who needs a date and music montages that feature songs that would even be blackballed by Radio Disney and you get Funky Monkey The climax to the movie A football game Played by thugs bumblers a chimp and the nerd boy No one seems to care about such substitutions at a high school football game Funky Monkey never lets up Its edge of your seat entertainment Some might even call this the American Beauty of monkeyfilled features After finishing this epic I recalled hearing a story about a railroad worker who lost much of his brain functions when a metal rod pierced his temporal lobe Funky Monkey is a metal rod among movies
1,Clouzot followed Le Corbeau where no one knew who was penning the poison thus everyone was suspected with another masterpiece Quai des Orfevres four years later in which we know from the outset or think we do whodunnit Topbilled Louis Jouvet doesnt appear for forty minutes by which time Clouzot has established a rich milieu of Music Hall music publishers etc and a fine cast of colourful characters Angela Lansbury lookalike Lansbury appeared in Woman of Paris that same year Suzy Delair scores as the chanteuse whose desire to improve her lot inspires the jealousy of her husbandaccompanist Bernard Blier who follows her to the home of an elderly letch only to find he is already dead From here things go seriously wrong his car is stolen before he leaves the premises so his prearranged alibi is out the window whilst meanwhile unknown to him his wife confesses to the murder to the photographer neighbour a closet lesbian in love with her who volunteers to return to the crime scene and retrieve Delairs scarf and as long as shes therethoughtfully wipes her prints of the murder weapon a champagne bottle At this point investigator Jouvet gets involved and from then on its a case of keeping the plates spinning in the air Clouzots output was relatively small but virtually all of it was as Spencer Tracey said in another context cherce with Le Salaire de peur and Les Diaboliques still to come In short this is a must for French cinema buffs

0,I am a fan of a few of the Vacation films but when a movie franchise goes from the big screen to the TV screen you know its out of steam Made for TV National Lampoon films do not do well on TV This movie is another reason I think a lot of us were excited when this was coming out but we also had to face the realityits a TV movie Randy Quaid is fine as Cousin Eddie but is better in a supporting role than the lead Dana Barron sets history as the first actor to reprise her role as one of the Griswold kids She is just as pretty but it doesnt help a thin script  Why was this movie even made It was probably because NBC recently picked up another few years of presenting Xmas Vacation There is nothing wrong with the acting Its all in the script Its just not that funny People need to think before they write stuff like this It is one Christmas movie I do not recommend
0,The first time I watched this movie I was ten years old I thought it was bad then and at that age I had no cinematic taste whatsoever I watched this movie on Cinemax about 3 days ago and was reminded why I hated the movie in the first place Madonnas character Nikki is annoying and obnoxious Theres no way that the main character would ever fall in love with her The jokes were corny and the dialogue was worse than a tv soap opera Im glad that I didnt see this movie at the theatre or rent it I feel bad for my parents who had to endure watching it with me Madonna is not necessarily a bad actress but in this role she is portrayed as a complete idiot

1,The first sidestory in the universal century Gundam universe presents a refreshing new look at the war between earth and the space colonies The focus is no longer on a small group of individuals who would go on to play pivotal roles in the conflict but on the everyday civilian population and how the war is seen through their eyes The story does contain some Gundam staples its premise being the attempts by a ZEON squad to capture an experimental Gundam but it the execution of the plot that made this show so interesting to watch This series focuses on the experiences of a young boy named Alfred and the relationship between his neighbor Christina Mckenzie who is secretly a Federation pilot and a newbie Zeon pilot named Bernie Wiseman Alfred develops a sort of brotherly love for Bernie while our young Zeon pilot also falls for Christina War in the Pocket proves that you do not need a sweeping epic tale about special individuals to make for a good war story There are no uber ace pilots or large scale fleet battles to be seen here This short 6 episode OVA focuses a lot more on character emotional drama over other themes like politics or philosophy and i love how realistically portrayed the characters are Alfred is your typical everyday kid who plays violent computer games and thinks the armed forces is cool He is then given a crash course in the horrible realities of war The unlikely friendship and bonding between Bernie and Christina each not knowing the fact that they are soldiers on different sides of the war is played very real without going overboard with the romance drama stuff Same goes for the endearing relationship between Alfred and Bernie That being said i would not want to spoil much of the story here but it makes it a whole lot more heart wrenching to watch the tragedies that unfold as the show moves along all the way to its emotionally devastating twist ending  Despite its lack of action this show never falls into the category of boring The characters are just that engaging enough to carry the whole show Not to worry as there are a number of mobile suit action scenes scattered here and there Each are beautifully animated on a level that surpasses that of an OVA and are sure to satisfy the craving for some mandatory mobile suit battles in a Gundam series Normally watching anime in Japanese or English i would leave up to personal preference But in this case i strongly recommend the English voice track over the Japanese one Not only do the characters whom all except Alfred are caucasian sound more believable in English but the performances of the English voice cast are on par and even surpass the Japanese one instilling each character with such realistic emotions and intonations that they sound just the acting in some live action TV dramas In short this show does not try to impress the audience What it does is conveys numerous heartwarming themes that hit closest to home especially the death of innocence on the battlefield and the horrors of war through the eyes of a child A truly moving little story that deserves more credit than it is being given
1,This movie is kind of good It seem that they used the Tyrannosaurus Rex like a blown up balloon just like Godzilla just maybe back in those 6070s days scientist havent got enough info on all sorts of dinosaurs Back in those time scientist still making dinosaur so I guess this movie was base on a Tyrannosaurus Rex movements back in the 6070s There even a part where a giant rock fired by someone at the Tyrannosaurus Rex it damage the Tyrannosaurus Rex and it was knock out for a little while At the end the Tyrannosaurus Rex went back to search for food There is something wrong in the movie as well like a rifle how can one rifle kill a Tyrannosaurus Rex when it could be 10005000 stronger than we are If this film going to make a remake I suggest make it more good and excited because watching a old movie seems like to have a remake of it if lucky

0,Spoilers Maybe a few details but nothing too plot related Not like it would matter with this movie  Air Rage blatantly rips off the midair infiltration premise of Executive Decision IceT leads a team of four elite commandos who wear baggy black shirts that we can only imagine must conceal invisible body armor as their idiotic tactics similar to what 3rd graders use when playing Star Wars on the playground lead them to absorb a hail of gunfire  What entertained me the most about this flick was the use of lookalike hasbeen actors Youll immediately recognize Cyril OReily as someone who once acted in a movie that you really liked though it was so long ago that you probably wont be able to place it it was Porkys Here Cyril plays a decent knockoff of a Bill Paxton character Most Hilarious is porker Gil Gerard whos so fat that you will never recognize him as TVs Buck Rogers Instead of evoking his mildly heroic character past Gerard gives us a passable performance of the crusty fat tough guy persona which was clearly imagineered for John Goodman Finally Alex Cord gives us a nice hybrid lookalike performance as a Chuck ConnorsKirk Douglas type In the 10 years since New Jack City IceTs acting has deteriorated remarkably Its not acting so much as regurgitation of lines that he might have actually memorized  One of the items that plays into this movie is a CDROM of classified information Its being hand carried and its apparently and unbelievably not encrypted despite the securitysavvy aura of Gerards NSA character What a joke Im severely doubting that the information purported to be on the CD would ever even all be assembled into a portable format  Despite being in a closed aircraft without silencers the gunfire is about as loud as canned air and causes nary a person to flinch so apparently no foley budget The assortment of weapons chosen is pretty funny The flight attendants use of a coffee pot is about the most realistic depiction of violence in the film When she takes intuitively to the miniUzi pistol which has got to be one of the worst pistol designs ever thats just too stupid A true elite team would carry MP5s for this type thing or maybe SOCOMM 45s or even customized Hi Powers if they were really old school or maybe something FN 57 if new school The lameo standard issue 92Fs are totally unbelievable having lost most of their cool after Lethal Weapon I The bad guys supposedly experienced soldier of fortune types have an assorted mixture of absurdity like the aforementioned miniUzi pistol and a Tec9 with the infamous nonfunctional barrel extender that isnt a silencer  There was one touch of realism on which I would like to correct the other reviewers The flight attendant and IceT did lower the craft to 10000 feet for breathable air before they opened the door And I also got the impression that the flight attendant was NOT able to get the door closed that she basically just gave up on that point As far as the landing there was no mention of flaps until about 2 seconds before touchdown Sigh  Only the Dukes of Hazard eluding Roscoe P Coltrane at the pass could shame this movie for use of stock footage They obviously chose the incredible and retired SR71 because they couldnt get stock of an F117 Aside from the fact that they were mothballed already in 2001 lets also forget for a moment that the SR71 is not a pure stealth aircraft in the sense of the B2 and that at point blank range Well Im no expert but Im having doubts as to whether it would be invisible on Radar  As others have pointed out the repeated references to F15s when they were showing F 16s was laughable Details of the 747 were pretty stupid No airline would put that few passengers on a 747 to begin with not to mention everything else that was idiotic about it Pay attention to the use of exposed electrical wiring  Wow What a show Catch it on Stars or something Dont pay to rent it but do watch it for laughs In contention for worst movie ever right up there with No Holds Barred which at least had some originality
1,The GREAT NEWS is that this film is now AVAILABLE on DVD from httptreasureflixcom for all those who wish to own it as well as on videoThis is good news as it is one of my favourite films I watched this film for the first time in the 80s and it is compulsory holiday viewing Living in the small market town called Tewkesbury picturesque and with its own traditionsof reenactmentsand traditions we are also a cosy tight community We are now also faced with large housing developments which threaten to destroy the Community and you can see why I love this film First of alland most important there are LASHINGS of snow Then there is the lovely legend of the Christmas Tree and also the Christian denouement as all the community cough up the money to help the destitute farmer save his farm and stay in the community The evil developersonly after the money are sent packing as the whole town pledge their money to help protect what they have  which is very special I love the way the whole community send their message to Santa via the post office which is misunderstood by the hero  He and his daughter have a long journey to make after the death of the wife and mother of the family There is a likely candidate for thiseven a sleigh ride and most heartwarming of all is that the taxi driver whose engine is broken is mysteriously given a new one on Christmas morning and noone had engineered it There is a lovely moment where Denver sings a lullaby and an exciting search Great gentle film for everything Christmas is really about
0,Also titled The Magical Castle This one is a stretch Why bother Why create another rockbart and then add another story line that has nearly nothing to do with the play nor swan lake Only some girlfriend of rockbart the stolen book of forbidden arts and the original characters not voices remain Stripped to to its bares this is a continuation by a thread Next thing you know some bird will have memorized the forbidden arts and Swan Princess 4 the magical bird will be born Thankfully though the chapters are supposedly closed and this will beginning but bad ended trilogy will come to a close
0,So youve got a number of models on an island and one by one theyre picked off Agatha Christiestyle We get somebody lost at sea pushed off a cliff poisoned by a solvent driven off a cliff blown up etc Nothing terribly graphic Before any of that starts one woman inexplicably has a dream of a killer in a weird human face mask The owner of the magazine is a sleaze who had an affair and somebody had photos taken of her before she was of age In the end its all about business or something Theres an 80s style montage of a photo shoot most of the bathing suits being onepieces surprisingly A couple are fairly translucent Theres camera clicks during the montage where the frame of the camera appears as a white square or rectangle within the picture The photographer is rather bad at framing
1,I watched this on HBO because it won the Oscar a week earlier It compares favorably with fictional courtroom dramas The story is of a 15yearold black kid placed on trial for the Jacksonville FL murder of an elderly white woman based almost solely on the identification by the victims husband and on a confession that the defense contends was coerced About half the footage is of the trial its supplemented with footage of the defense lawyers two public defenders explaining their case interviewing witnesses and visiting key locations This is edited with a minimum of needless repetition and placed in logical order The camera work is pretty solid And theres a mildly surprising epilogue
1,Its easy to make really general comments about a film like this The fact that its one of the only remaining Japanese films from this era causes people to say that it started Japanese cinema and was unlike anything the west ever made The latter of these two comments is particularly false as Kinugasa himself admitted to ripping off Caligari on more than one occasion But style was meant to be imitated and doesnt take away from this films importance What we have here is experimental themes and composition built on already established visual styles opening the doors for a truly brilliant layering of narratives and realities For this purpose the madhouse is the ideal setting and the writers knew this This is a landmark film and every effort should be made to track it down 5 out of 5  Essential
0,Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film Bad mistake Ive seen 950 films and this is truly one of the worst of them  its awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack the films only song  a lame country tune  is played no less than four times The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credits of a film  The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1score is Harvey Keitel  while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort One for Keitel obsessives only
1,Love is overwhelming In all its manifestations Gorgeous absolutely gorgeous Tudor Chirila Maria Popistasu and Ioana Barbu one truly dramatic story about love in all its shapes a story about the undecipherable ways of young hearts about life and lost innocence all directed by the skillful eye of Tudor Giurgiu With a magnificent soundtrack featuring Faultline  Chris Martin and Vama Veche it surprises in every way leaving behind the sour taste of misunderstanding love Truly remarkable Is it me or is Romanian cinematography slowly but surely advancing and gaining respect This is a brilliant film Two thumbs up to everybody involved
1,Last night I saw A PECK ON THE CHEEK KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles Oddly it was 137 minutes longslightly longer than the time listed on IMDb At first I found myself losing interest in this film because the rather confusing style of filming really lost me The context for what was occurring was missing and I am glad I stuck with it At the beginning a young couple is married and shortly after the wedding war breaks out in their native Sri Lanka and the lovers are separated Months later the wife is very pregnant and on board a refugee vessel heading to India At a refugee center you see the lady about to give birthafter which the titles to the film finally are revealed The entire focus of the film then changes completelyto a young girl who is about to turn 9 in Madras India You see her in her home and she talks to the camera about her life and family None of this seems that interesting or important and you wonder what is missingwhat about the lady who was about to give birth My wife and I debated this and we finally guessed that this little girl was actually the child of the lady in the first part of the film Somehow or another she had been adopted and was talking about her life with mom and dad 2though she did NOT realize these people were not her biological parents Soon after this the parents revealed themselves to be total idiots one of the complaints I had about the film as they decided to tell this very young girl the truth about her parentage AND tell it in a way that left the girl emotionally screwed up and confused Despite a stupid decision and telling her in the worst way the parents made up for this by agreeing to help her find her biological mother Seeing the impact all this had on the girl and parents particularly the adoptive mother was impressive to watch and sure sparked my interest Unfortunately Sri Lanka has been involved in a very very long and brutal civil war with Tamilese militants off and on for three decades The familys decision to look for the mom back in Sri Lanka was indeed noble but also a bit stupid at timesas they took so many risks and nearly got killed again and again by just blindly jumping into the middle of a war This was all exciting and captivating but also left me wondering about the sanity of the adoptive parentsfirst you tell her she ISNT your biological child and now you take her in the middle of a WAR ZONE Sure the kid really wanted to meet her biological mother but this really was stupid in hind sight If it were me I might have been tempted to pay an unemployed actress to play the part and fool the kidthus avoiding being in the middle of a war Despite my complaints the film was lovely to watch and was very rewarding Far from perfect it sure hits an emotional home run Also while I expected this because I have seen several Indian films many Westerners will be a bit surprised by the vivid songs that seem to come out of no wherethis IS standard in most films from Indiaincluding those made in Bollywood Bombay and TamilwoodKollywood Madras
1,As a producer of indie movies and a harsh critic of such I have to say I loved this movie It is funny and intelligent well directed and entertaining Hats off to the producers and directors for making a good one Ill be watching for the next one I gave it a 10
0,A plane carrying a rich scientists daughter goes down in thick wilderness He assembles a group to go and find her and the others but the rescue party soon suspects that something is stalking them Then ulterior motives for the expedition are revealed and that only adds to the already existing tension The movie is a decent idea and a take on the popular Sasquatch legend was bound to wind up on film sooner or later However the films direction breaks a fundamental rule of horrorthriller directing and that is showing too much too soon Of course the audience knows there is something stalking the characters just read the title But showing what should have been the films kicker that early just ruins most of the suspense and as a direct result much of the fun The film also lacks a good atmosphere and there are almost no landscape shots that show the expanse of the wilderness but there are plenty monster pointofview shots that add nothing to anything They actually knock off Predator quite shamelessly The lowbudget horror film Wendigo did what this film tries to do much better Some of the character tensions and a nonclichÃ© ending manage to make up for this rise above the crap pile but it is still poor and given the premise and potential very disappointing  410 Rated R for some violence and profanity but its pretty tame compared to most Rrated horror
0,Although I am generally a proponent of the wellmade film I do not limit myself to films which escape those boundaries and more often than not I do enjoy and admire films that successfully break the rules And it is quite true that director Pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema But it is also my opinion that he does not break them successfully or to any actual point Pasolinis work is visually jarring but this is less a matter of what is actually on the screen than how it is filmed and the jumpiness of his films seem less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography This is true of DECAMERON Pasolini often preferred to use nonactors and while many directors have done so with remarkable result under Pasolinis direction his nonactors tend to remain nonactors This is also true of DECAMERON Pasolini quite often includes images designed to shock offend or otherwise disconcert the audience Such elements can often be used with startling effect but in Pasolinis hands such elements seldom seem to actually contribute anything to the film This is also true of DECAMERON I have been given to understand there are many people who like even admire Pasolinis films Even so I have never actually met any of them and I have never been able to read anything about Pasolini or his works that made the reason for such liking or admiration comprehensible to me Judging him from his works alone I am of the opinion that he was essentially an amateurish director who did not break the rules so much by choice as by lack of skilland who was initially applauded by the intelligentsia of his day for  existential boldness thereby simply confirming him in bad habits as a film maker I find his work tedious unimpressive and pretentious And this too is true of DECAMERON It is also sadly true of virtually every Pasolini film it has been my misfortune to endure
1,It was a doubly interesting experience For some reason the greatest scientific mind of the 20th Century had never been the central figure in a movie The closest I can think of as films with Einstein in them are CHAMPAIGN FOR CAESAR where like a deus ex machina the great man is heard clarifying a point on a radio quiz show so that Ronald Colman is proved to have given the correct answer after all and in BULLSHOT where the great Albert is one of a dozen leading physicists and scientists who are drugged with cannabis by the villain intent on stealing some machines of theirs It is notable that in those two cases and in IQ we are dealing with comedies So far nobody has tried to do a serious film about the life of Einstein like John Hustons attempt to do one on FREUD with Montgomery Cliff I guess it is just too hard to get the world of mathematical equations or the secrets of electromagnetic field theory into exciting dialog But then only three years ago Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer did A BEAUTIFUL MIND Maybe nobody really has tried Subsequently after writing this I remembered the successful comedy YOUNG EINSTEIN with Yahoo Serious about ten years ago But that is an exception and it was a spoof The other surprise was the actor playing the great Albert It was Walter Matthau here taking time away from the series of films he did with Jack Lemmon in that last decade of their careers Matthau was a highly capable and gifted character actor in both comedy and drama but normally his comic personas were variants of his Whiplash Willie Gingrich from THE FORTUNE COOKIE They were connivers and gonifs Later they would shed their criminal propensities because we had grown to like them but they remained grumpy types But his Albert Einstein happens to be genuinely sweet More like his Kotch than like Willie Clarke He plays Albert as good old uncle Albert It seems that Matthaus Einstein is living in Princeton with his niece Catherine Boyd Meg Ryan and she is seeing a stuffy professor named James Morland Stephen Fry But Frys car needs repairs and they take it to the auto shop where Ed Walters Tim Robbins works Robbins falls for Ryan who is attracted to him  but finds that he lacks the mental equipment that she admires Good old uncle Albert aided by his three friends Lou Jacobi Joseph Maher and Gene Saks decide to give their assistance to Robbins and make him an apparently unrecognized physics genius This will open the doors of romance between him and Ryan provided Ryan is impressed and Fry does not spoil things as he hopes to do The atmosphere is sweet as when Matthau and his chums rig up a super physics quiz that they help Robbins cheat on by switching the positions of their bodies The plot eventually leads to the outright lie that the brilliant Robbins has constructed an atomic powered rocket ship  which brings in the interests of the nation in the figure of President Eisenhower Keene Curtis It was a charming comedy and an interesting stretch for Matthau in that he was not as hyper as normal but far more subdued
0,This is just about the WORST piece of garbage Ive ever had the displeasure of sitting through The story was embarrassingly amateurish the graphics were horrible and the acting Ive never seen worse acting in my entire life A kindergarten class could come up with a scarier better written and more entertaining concept than this I pity anyone who wastes their time on this film as well as the actors who agreed to doing the job It was obvious that they were not given appropriate direction The writers must have spent their time at film school in the back room playing peaknuckle A lot of professors wasted a lot of time on these two I would be truly embarrassed to admit that I knew them
1,Its a spoof its an intelligent comedy it has some a pathetic action and choreography and mind it it is intentional good hummable songs good performances by the entire cast brilliant by Amir Salman and Paresh and over all an script which is so rare in Indian cinema that too in comedy watch David Dhawan Harmesh Malhotra etc Story is of two wastrels whose only aim is to get rich and famous by any which ways They come across one such way when they find out that a rich NRI is coming India to get married Rest of the story is about oneupmanship and how these wastrels try to out wit each other Entire cast is perfectly cast right from Deven Verma till Viju Khote Songs are rightly placed and are funny Surprise package is Salman who acts with perfect timing and this particular act gave him his style of comedy All an all a fum film which you should not ignore if you like and watch Indian Cinema
1,Nicolas Mallet is a failure A teller in a bank everyone walks all over him Then his friend a writer whos books no one likes has a plan to change his life Our hero tells his boss he is quitting He intends to spend the rest of his life making a great deal of money and sleeping with a great many women And he manages to do just that If it were not for the amount of death murdersuicidenatural causes in the film this would be a farce There are numerous jabs at marriage politics journalism andlife JeanLouis Trintignant is a likable amoral rogue Romy Schneider is at her most appealing Definitely worth a look
1,Those two main characters Erkan and Stefan are a munich comedy act I was wondering if this is one of these typical slapstick movies where the story is either not important or simply not existing But when I saw this movie I was very happy that there is a cool story and the main characters really fit in it All in all very amusing and not a common german movie
0,I am a German student so sorry for eventually mistakes Im working on it   The stylistic very interesting converted and with effective sound effects accentuated platitudinous action of the drama deflect in no way from the horrible bad actors insincere and unnatural moves and expressions of feelings and makes so the relatively weird and senseless story less better Just the typical slashergenre with in this case very odd action Many byplays destroy partly the main story and let the viewers up to the end into the dark create weirdness and let surmise the senses of actions and the point mere hazily For sure its an hit for slasherfans but not for me But although the interesting style of cinematography and adeptly use of light is turned out well So not the best one
0,This owes a great deal to the plot of CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS Although he is quite grown up it is partly the story of a wealthy lad who is shanghaied as a crew member aboard a cargo vessel and becomes a man in the process Moran of the title is a boyish young woman also brought up on a vessel owned by her father When the cargo burns she and crew members are evacuated to our lads ship However the captain has smuggling on his mind and his intentions are not honorable where Moran is concerned The inevitable ensues  our lad falls for the mannish Moran and she for him In the end evil is subdued and the lovers are united Some interesting dialogue points out that Moran belongs to no man and no woman A nod to Sappho here Dorothy Dalton is appropriately sexless as Moran and not too attractive either Valentino does well in a romantic action role His sexy build and physique are shown off to advantage and the role is quite a masculine one He is very appealing This is no great film but it passes the time What it really showcases is Valentinos beauty and sexiness
1,I am only 11 years old but I discovered Full House when I was about five and watched it constantly until I was seven Then I grew older and figured Full House could wait and that I had more important things to do Plus there was also the fact that my younger brother who watched it faithfully with me for those two years started to dislike it thinking it too girly  Then I realized every afternoon at five it was on 23 and I once again became addicted to it Full House has made me laugh and cry Its made me realize how nice it would be if our world was like the world of Full House plus a mom I have heard people say Full House is cheesy and unbelievable But look at the big picture three girls whose mom was killed by a drunk driver The sisters fight and get their feelings hurt The three men who live with the girls can get into bickers at times Whats any more real than that  If anything the show has lifted me up when Im down and brought me up even higher when I thought I was at the point of complete happiness I have howled like a hyena at the show and gained a massive obsessiveness over Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen Of course Hilary Duff has now taken that spot but they were literally the cutest babies I have ever seen They are great actresses and seem to be very nice people
1,Ah Hitchcock Its hard to find a bad Hitchcock movie until he lost it after THE BIRDS 1963 and SABOTEUR proves the point Having admired most of this directors work for many years I had managed to skip this one perhaps from lack of interest in Priscilla Lane and Robert Cummings as lead actors I was of course familiar with the Statue of Liberty climax from having seen it repeatedly in film retrospectives but I wrongly assumed the story leading up to it might not hold my interest Was I wrong The suspenseful plot gets cooking right off the bat through a chance encounter between the Bad Guy Saboteur and the Good Guy Wrongly Accused protagonist and continues zooming along through a series of further chance encounters and narrow escapes Familiar Hitchcockian elements are all there the innocent person wrongly accused of a crime people not being what they seem to be dramatic or unlikely locations that intensify the suspenseful scene being played out within them an airplane hangar a ranch a bridge from which the handcuffed hero hurls himself to escape the police a sumptuous charity ball in a palatial mansion an upper floor of a skyscraper and finally the torch of the Statue of Liberty Throughout is humor provided by supporting players generous dollops of early WW2 vintage social comment moments of human warmth where suffering people find it within themselves to lend a hand to help a fellow human getting nothing in return Â– in short there was always a basic humanity at the core of Hitchcock however grisly the trappings  a sensational cast of supporting players chiefly Otto Kruger as the slickest villain this side of George Sanders his Broadway credits include the male lead in Noel Cowards PRIVATE LIVES Â– and that says it all and weaselly Norman Lloyd as the titular saboteur not to mention Alma Kruger Â– no relation to Otto Â– as a prominent society dowager involved in fifth column intrigue her character foreshadows that of Claude Rainss mother in NOTORIOUS Priscilla Lane does a fine job with a difficult role For most of her early scenes we cant tell whether she believes the hero to be innocent or guilty and she seems constantly to shift her opinion not coming over to his side fully until late in the proceedings One cannot ascertain whether her acting is at fault or whether we are meant to be kept in a state of uncertainty but the plot developments are so swift fun and clever that we really dont care what she thinks Then there are the peculiar Hitchcock touches that have nothing to do with the plot Twice the Lane character pauses to get change for a quarter Â– once to reimburse her kidnappers for an ice cream soda and again to make a call from a phone booth Why these scenes were inserted are anybodys guess perhaps to make the film seem more realistic and thus heighten the believability and suspense Or perhaps to give the audience a moment to catch its breath Some of the characters are over the top Â– the garrulous truck driver the impossibly kind and trusting blind man living alone in a spotlessly maintained forest cabin the politicalphilosophyspouting human skeleton and other members of the circus caravan who hide the protagonists from their pursuers
1,After seeing this film at the SF Independent Film Festival I couldnt wait to hear about how to get a copy Jim McKay gave a talk QA about the film afterward which presented his ironic situation how to get distribution for a film which portrays minorities women nonwhites working on resolving controversial issues teen pregnancy teen motherhood racial identity singlemother households and how to write a faithful script on all of these topics being a midthirties white male The multiracial multigendered audience of mostlyadults raved about the films fantastic storyline detailed characters and fantastic portrayal of real teen life Most of the teens however had left the buildingleading me to think this is a film best seen by adults with kids as a starting point for discussion rather than as many adults there felt a film teens should see because its about them Hence distribution questionshow do we get our hands on it The Internet retail would be a great paththis is a film that will be buried like Pups or other radical modern teen filmsand McKay seemed responsive As for his credits as a writerdirector McKay was extremeley sensitive and detailed in his workallying himself to the Crown Heights neighborhood in which the film is set working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should bewith the results being disarmingly realistic
0,This movie was by far the worst movie Ive ever had to endure I couldnt believe that they tried to pass it off as a serious movie it was so bad I couldnt even laugh at its pathetic attempt to entertain me If you want cheesy horror that you can laugh at rent Dr Giggles instead
1,IQ is a cute romantic comedy featuring two great actors that seem to click well on screen Plot is a typical guy wrong for girl guy gets girl format but makes the solid point that one must love with the heart and not the the mind Addition of Albert Einstein and his band of geniuses provides excellent comic relief Overall a good movie Not great but good
1,I LOVE the Doodlebops My son has been watching them for over a year We went to the Doodlebops concert last year as well as one concert yesterday connecticut He LOVES them The doodlebops do not teach the alphabet or numbers but who cares are you being serious the TV isnt suppose to teach your children about numbers or the alphabet the parents should Get over it The Doodlebops actually CAN sing Deedee has a beautiful voice and in concert you can tell all 3 of them have nice singing voices and do NOT lip sing Imagine they dance jump around and STILL sing they have talent the kids love them i even enjoy watching the show This show is by far the best show on TV for kids AND a rock band for children How amazing is that Why are people saying Chad rooney is gay where did you hear that from Whether he is or not He is awesome Leave him alone Its not like he or anyone else is promoting homosexuality to our children
0,Another British cinema flag waver Real garbage on offer here once again I cannot understand and I am British why this over the top patriotic nonsense was ever made EIGHT years mark you from when the second world war had actually ended Other commenters here have remarked on the editing and apparent seamless use of archive footage This is extremely poorly observed The archive footage is in abundance Model aircraft swing from wires in the action scenes like so many childrens kites in the wind The usual map room sequences tattoo the movie to make us supposedly drawn into the whole Malta event Guinness must have his worst acting performance ever The shocking back drop dog fight scenes are laughable Hawkins bores us all to death in the map room area Ealing made many great movies This clearly is not one of them They should have stayed away from such unconvincing rot
0,Spoilers I hate this one but it is better than the others after this they just keep getting worse I hope Gibson has the smarts to stay out of the next one A lot of the same with humor ie the toilet kids etc How much farther can we watch their relationship evolve Drugs bad guys why South Africa I found that unbelievable maybe South American some country in the Golden Triangle would have made the script better It seems the late 80 early 90s had the blond bad guys ie Die Hard the mighty Ducks play Ice Land Gary Busey in the last Weapon etc Hollywood repeats itself over This one with a similar story has to go over the top The attacking the police the beach condo scene and the fight at the end and way over the top Gibsons girlfriend killed by the copper attack were too much Like many part 2s they get worse and 3 or 4 in this series picks up speed downhill 310
1,Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made An example of the directing When Candy Jean Peters starts going through her purse and notices her wallet is missing an alarm goes off in the background in the building shes in  as if its an alarm going off in her head Its not cartoonlike  its subtly woven into the background in a way that strikes you on a subconscious level until youve seen the film a few times and it just clicks that theres an alarm bell going off when she starts frantically going through her bag Richard Widmark is way on top of his game as a smartalec  hes really great  but the highlight performance of the film was the first scene for Moe the street peddlerinformer played by Thelma Ritter Later in her apartment you are not seeing a movie  youre seeing a real person Ive never seen anyone act so real I felt like I was looking into a real room until Ritters performance  right down to the way her hair stuck out a bit when she removed her hat  About a million other things just worked from the way Lightning Louie picks up money with his chopsticks to the way Candys jewelry clicks when she flicks Moes hand away from her brooch to the way Moe gets the dollars and change from the police captain across the FBI guys chest  and even the way the captain opens his filing cabinet like hes been doing it in that way in that room for many years Pickup On South Street is detailed moves directing with consummate performances acting and superb nownostalgic visuals of the day such as the panel truck the boards leading to the shack out on the water the dumbwaiter  and the unforgettable place Skip stashes his pocket pickings Wonderful stuff Pickup On South Street is also one of the few movies where even though the characters arent perfect you do care about them  perhaps because they have been somewhat branded by their pasts in ways that are hard to escape Skip as a threetime loser and Candy as a youngish woman who has knocked around a lot When these people behave a little more badly than youd expect its in sort of novel ways that make it seem youre looking in at people youd never otherwise imagine  and yet you know that they are possible because the actors make them so recognizably human
1,Just went on YouTube and finally watched this Oscarnominated animated short directed by Richard Condie I had previously watched his funny Getting Started there In this one a couple are playing Scrabble The wife keeps shaking her eyes while her husband has nothing but Es on his side The wife leaves for a while to vacuum her bed and bathtub before catching her husband looking at her side Briefly before this the husband catches a TV show called Sawing for Teens with the stars sawing something and the husband getting his own saw That program gets interrupted by a special report of a nuclear war happening the newsman is a skeleton here as everyone panics outside though the husband fell asleep during this time and thinks a parade is going on as he and his wife continue arguing about the gameTheres plenty of other bizarre things going on before the touching ending comes on Quite hilarious and well worth seeing for any animation buff out there Cant wait to see any more animated shorts from Mr Condie
0,This movie is really BAD there is nothing appealing or worth of commentary in it except for the beautiful settings Chilean landscape I know I must supply four lines as a commentary for this movie but the thing is that it is such a bad movie that I can only say that is actually BAD Michael Ironside is the only one who saves the money in the film
1,No this is not no Alice fairy tale my friends This Wonderland fable is based on the true story of the gruesome bloody Wonderland murders that occurred back in 80s California At the center of this bloodbath was no other than Johnny Wad himself Yes John Holmes Daddy dingdong used other shotguns than his infamous 13inch milk machine Besides being a legendary adult film actor Holmes was as also a hardcore drug addict who befriended various Hollywood junkies Val Kilmer was occasionally majestic as Holmes but for once this Holmes character did not milk it through completely The film possesses a whos who of supporting players Josh Lucas  Dylan Mcdermott as Hollywood riffraffs  Kate Bosworth  Lisa Kudrow as the women in Holmes life and Eric Bogosian as a menacing Tinsletown entrepreneur These characters do play integral parts directly or indirectly in the Wonderland murders Out of this support group it was Josh Lucas who was the most fierce  impressive as the ardent Ron Launius Lucas is gradually escalating into a major Hollywood player with such charismatic turns in A Beautiful Mind  Sweet Home Alabama Director James Cox sometime proved to be a bit of a coxsucker by displaying a vast amount of overextended scenes just like Holmes famous organ Holmes was eventually acquitted of the Wonderland murders He died of complications from the Aids virus Wonderland will keep you wondering what really happened that bloody night and if Holmes really laid out his weapon Oops Wrong Holmes movie Ok That is enough before I get penislized I mean penalized Bye Holmies  Average

1,Comic secret agents have made a comeback in recent years with Mike Myers Austin Powers and Rowan Atkinsons Johnny English and more recently Steve Carell in the bigscreen version of the hit 60s show Get Smart Back in 1974 it was David Jason who was wearing a shoulder holster and carrying an attachÃ© case full of documents marked Classified The Top Secret Life Of Edgar Briggs was his first starring role in a sitcom after years of being a supporting actor in such shows as Six Dates With Barker the Doctor series and Hark At Barker Humphrey Barclay had found him working in a pier theatre in Bournemouth and was sufficiently impressed to include him alongside Michael Palin Terry Jones and Eric Idle in the childrens comedy show Do Not Adjust Your Set TTSLOEB cast Jason as Edgar Briggs a wellmeaning but incompetent agent for the Secret Intelligence Service Whereas John Steed wore a bowler hat Briggs had a trilby Whereas Napoleon Solo carried a radio pen Briggs owned a pipe Objects fell to bits in his hands He read Confidential documents in bed while his wife  Barbara Angell  perused Womans Own  on one occasion it would be the other way round  When he tracked a pair of Russian agents to a heliport he accidentally switched on the airports Tannoy system and broadcast his plans to capture them When he hid on a train so as to photograph a meeting between an SIS man and his enemycontact it moved off with him aboard and took him straight to Brighton When he tried to organise the defection of a female Russian scientist he took a short cut to elude his pursuers only to wind up hopelessly lost in a car park Yet like Inspector Clouseau he always seemed to come out on top at the end much to the dismay of his colleagues As previously mentioned he was married His wife Jennifer was understanding about the sort of work he did Though they had a row once which resulted in her yelling at him from the window of their highrise flat Secret Service this Secret Service that You never stop thinking about the Secret Service He shouted back Think of the neighbours Theyre not supposed to know Im in the Secret Service Briggs was part of a team of agents whose number included Coronation Street villain Mark Eden  he was the psychotic Alan Bradley  as Spencer Michael Stainton as Buxton and Doctor At Seas Elisabeth Counsell as the lovely Cathy Strong They answered to The Commander played by the late Noel Coleman The Commander was kidnapped in one episode leaving Briggs temporarily in charge of the SIS  which naturally horrified everyone This hilarious show was by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna who had written for the Doctor series Rather than spoof Bond it was more of a sendup of the serious spy shows such as Callan  though it had a Bondstyle theme tune  Furtive meetings in underground car parks codebreaking stolen missile plans that kind of thing Jason brought a lot of energy to the role doing a lot of his own stunts such as Briggs falling off a ladder whilst decorating his flat and tumbling down a hill in a wastepaper bin and were reminiscent of those to be found in the Pink Panther films Briggs had all the ingredients to be a smashhit Unfortunately it was not networked In the London area it was put out on Sundays at 725 PM where it was trounced in the ratings by the BBCs soapy drama The Brothers It was then moved to Fridays at 7 PM because ITV wanted to showcase its latest American import  the TV version of Planet Of The Apes Briggs never found an audience A similar fate befell Jasons next major show 1976s Lucky Feller It was not until 1977 and A Sharp Intake Of Breath that he found his first successful solo vehicle You can see the title sequence  along with two brief excerpts in German  for this series on YouTube Unfortunately that is all you can see Jason will not permit his early starring shows either to be repeated or released on DVD A great shame For the moment however Edgar Briggs life will have to remain top secret CODA I have seen a number of episodes recently and Im pleased to say it stands up incredibly well
1,Amazing performance from Simon Pegg who just gets better and better with every role As usual he plays the part of a very cringy character who makes you want to hide behind your cushion in embarrassment for him sometimes but thats what Pegg is all about The laughs were regular and eye watering and everyone of them aimed at Penn The movie was very cleverly put together where every character plays a very sophisticated and serious part with Penn being the only humour involved which is a huge credit to the Director Robert Weide And I cant let this one go without a quick round of applause to Gilliam Anderson who shone throughout Highly recommended to all
0,This movie was beyond disappointment Well acted story that means nothing The plot is ridiculous and even what story there is goes absolutely nowhere It truly isnt worth a nickel buffalo or otherwisepun intended
1,The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched would become boring and depressing even My advice is to watch it maybe once or twice a year with a couple of mates and a few drinks In todays climate of TV Media domination and the capitalist mode in society it really does work as a revisionist social commentary post 1980sboom Forget that though There are other brilliant and better reasons to watch this film Schwarzenegger is on top form as Ben The Butcher of Bakersfield Richards and the inclusion of Bondbelting one liners was completely inspiredthety are truly legenddary with his rant to Killian over a camera the main highlight The design of the stalkers is authentically American and mirrors the characterizations seen in the PC Gladiators TV show and the WWE as well Buzzsaws grisly end will chill any viewer to the core as a foot note why does his death stand out as particularly disturbing in what is ostensibly an upbeat actioner with a bitter sense of humour Jesse Venturer and Sven Ole Thorssen are great as backing muscle and are Arnies buds in real life and its even got Mick Fleetwood in it too What more could you ask for I highly recommend the Running Man if youre looking for a great piece of entertaining action with a glossty finish and some great characters Just dont expect an education from it at least on surface value Quality I bloody love it actually You will too unless youre a thesp 710
0,This is a strange sex comedy because theres very little comedy but a whole lot of sex  most of which takes place in the back of a car and is so graphic it makes BASIC INSTINCT look like an edition of TELETUBBIES  I kid you not  the sex in this film is so in your face it might just choke you  especially if youre watching with your grandparents  As for the rest of RITA  SUE AND BOB TOO theres not much else worth mentioning except the language where every single sentence seems to contain the F word  This a rather bleak hyperrealist British film made at a time when Channel 4 was the main investor in British movies which explains its made for television low budget feel
1,El Padrino has just been released in Europe and is really kicking ass This film with its great cast  Damian Chapa  Blood in Blood Out  Robert Wager Jennifer Tilly Robert Wagner and many more   is the best gangster movie since SCARFACE A Film that everyone MUST SEE 2 hours full of action with fantastic unbelievable stunt  GRACIAS JENNIFER  We are eagerly waiting for part 2  Does anyone know if there will be one  Keep up the good work  I loved it 
0,Humour is a very individual thing and the audience at the sneak preview of The Wog Boy seemed to enjoy it more than I did I found it an anachronistic affair more representative of the old fashioned racial humour of the Australian cinema of the 1960s and 1970s The boy meets girl plot never takes off because of a lack of chemistry between Lucy Bell and Nick Giannopoulos while I found laughs thin on the ground If you want to spend your money on this wait until its on video

0,This is a voice of a person who just finished watching the second season of Rome almost at one go and grabbed the opportunity to see what happened next  this film conveniently takes off where Rome ends If you find Rome an abomination a foul mouthed screwfest of little historical accuracy then you might enjoy Imperium Augustus But if you feel Rome is a good thing if you enjoy the complicated intrigue the ambiance of decadence and the work of the actors then Imperium will obviously appear to you as an overly timid superfluous and tedious soap opera with not many redeeming factors There are some actors who for my taste look somewhat better than these in Rome I especially disliked Romes image of Cleopatra as a drugsoaked sex addict There must have been a great deal of strength and dignity in that woman and the actress in Imperium suits the part much better OToole and Rampling are good and so are some others But then If you have come to know  and love  Atia as the super cool bitch youll find the depiction of her in Imperium  as a tearjerking mother goose in an apron  absolutely ridiculous There are supposed to be some bitchy characters in Imperium but these actresses rely heavily upon staring at the men and nothing much more Youll find no interesting female characters in this epic Theres also the painfully comic Maecenas whom we see as a screeching drag queen even though there is little historical evidence that he was such hes once referred to as being effeminate in his pleasures in the annals The interiors are rather meager and rely on clichÃ©s upon clichÃ©s Cleopatras big hall looks like something out of a computer game or a childrens play room in an Egyptian theme park Theres a looooooooot of really poor 3D graphics not up to 2003 standards The action is presented as a series of flashbacks the aged Augustus is reliving So we get a quick look at some historical events some of which are presented well whereas some are not An disproportional amount of time is wasted to show Livia as the eternal flame of Augustus This affair doesnt sizzle for even a moment the dialog is superlame and everything is seasoned with tacky tearinducing musical score Whatever amount of reality the show aims to capture every last shred of it is destroyed by the dry synchronized dubbing most of the actors are non English speakers Everything is lukewarm in this epic True there are more historical accuracies than in Rome but dramatically speaking its plain boring The characters lack depth and the dialog sharpness Camerawork is often reduced to static shots and lighting offers nothing to please your eye Theres really noone to love and noone to hate in Imperium Regardless of whether you liked or disliked Rome there are much better films and miniseries around Ancient Rome The Rise and Fall of an Empire would be one thing I recommend
0,This movie was bad beyond belief I saw it during the 2004 San Francisco Film Festival Before it started the owner of the theatre got up and told us how half the audience had left the theatre the night before which happened to be its world premiere I dont think anyone in the theatre understood just how bad the movie was going to be at that point We all understood by the end  Its not a documentary though it was sort of sold as one Dark Angel was a bad biography and misguided homage to Bettie Paige in which half the movie is actually just remakes of old Bettie Paige movies The movie is only 90 minutes long and the content of those 90 minutes is sub par to say the least A scene would start going then someone would say wow youre so great Bettie why dont we make another movie this would be followed by a 5 minutes of a Bettie Paige remake which was almost as ridiculous as and even more boring than the normal part of the movie by the end of the movie people were laughing every time another Bettie Paige movie remake came up it was that ludicrous I heard a lot of laughter in that theatre but people were not laughing with the movie maker they were laughing at the movie and its poor content and structure This was easy to tell as the parts that would get the most laughs were the ones which were supposed to be serious or revelatory  I know movies are expensive I have seen many cheaply made independent films but somehow the cinematography and quality of this movie set it apart from anything else I have ever seen The movie looks like it was made for 12 The cuts the graininess and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience This movie makes Dude Wheres My Car look like Citizen Kane  My friends and I left the theatre feeling like we had just paid 8 dollars to be tortured The only redeeming part of the experience was that we got to laugh about the fact that someone had actually made this movie and thought it was good Apparently the previous night the night of the world premiere the directorwriterproducer had been in the audience and had gotten to witness people laugh at and walk out on his movie Bettie Paiges movies were destroyed They should destroy this movie too
1,THE STUDENT NURSES is not a typical sexploitation movie Sure the nudity and sexual openness is there but its not all for laughs Stephanie Rothman scripted a socially compelling wellwritten tits  ass movie which confronts the topics of racism socioeconomic inequalities rape abortion medical ethics public health issues human rights the Vietnam war free love LSD and drug experimentation Four sexy college roommates are taking their nursing internships at the same time Sharon Elaine Giftos is assigned to the terminal care ward Lynn Brioni Farrell to public health administration Priscilla Barbara Leigh to gynecology and Phred Karen Carlson to psychiatry These four beauties have ample opportunities to disrobe and fornicate of which they take advantage much to the delight of male viewers These are liberated women at the height of the sexual revolution after all and are as intelligent as they are horny and beautiful Visceral yet lowbudget action sequences are interspersed throughout Theres a very bloody gunfight at the resistance movement headquarters in which two policemen are shot and killed along with several members of the group An antiVietnam war protest consisting of spookilydressed young people of all races painted like skeletons becomes violent with cops beating protesters The effective trip sequence on the beach consists of beautiful weird and confusing sensory and memory montages with hypersensual overtones In short THE STUDENT NURSES is a thoughtful and compelling reflection of the times expressed through real womens perspectives since it was written and directed by a woman But its still fun and titillating despite its sobering treatment of subject matter
0,I like musicals but as a Dickens fan I HATE this one MILD SPOILERS Starving boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workhouse The poor of London coming out to sing Fagin and Dodger walking off into the sunset Not exactly faithful to the novel As I recall Dodger was publicly hanged and Fagin went crazy in prison END OF SPOILERS Oliver Reed is very weak as Sykes doing little more than growling to indicate his evil Worst however is Mark Lester as Oliver who often comes across so awkward and passive you wonder if hes really the main character His portrayal is in no way helped by the fact that the best they could do when he sings is dub in the voice of a girl Guess they didnt realize that boy trebles can be found in almost every church in England Selfrespecting Dickens fans stick to David Leans amazing 1948 film or the BBC 6hour adaptation from the mid80s Avoid this bloated whitewash of a musical
1,I just love this movie and I have my TV programed to record it when it comes on again on Nov 2nd It is a really nice love story with a twist The song that is played at the end of the movie is one you would not think would be a big hit but it is a song that stays in your head and I am now trying to find that song so I can hear it and play it I really have no style of the shows I see or the songs I like to hear and there for makes me pretty open to seeing things new with an open mind I would like to say there is some parts in this movie that is not meant for the whole family to watch This movie does show skin It is kinda like a lifetime movie for women about women I say watch the movie and you may just like it as much as I did
1,One of the great things about The Best Years of Our Lives that even though it dates itself rather firmly in the post World War II era the issues it talks about are as real today as they were on VE or VJ day of 1945 The problem of how to assimilate returning war veterans is as old as the written history of our planet And while we dont often learn from history we can be thankful that for once the United States of America did learn from what happened with its veterans after the previous World War The GI Bill of Rights is mentioned in passing in The Best Years of Our Lives was possibly the greatest piece of social legislation from the last century So many veterans did take advantage of it as do the veterans like Fredric March Dana Andrews and Harold Russell who you see here All three of those actors played archetypal veterans characters that every corner of the USA could identify with They all meet on an army transport plane flying to the home town of all of them Boone City Iowa War is a great leveler of class and distinction Bank employee March soda jerk Andrews and high school football star Russell probably would never meet in real life even in a small town like Boone City But they do meet and war forges indestructible bonds that can never be broken March is the oldest a man with two children and Hollywoods perfect wife Myrna Loy He settles in the first and the best He has some wonderful scenes getting cockeyed drunk on his return and later with a little bit of liquor in him tells the bank officials at a banquet off in no uncertain terms I also love his scene where another returning veteran a sharecropper wants to get a bank loan for his own piece of land Watch Marchs expressions as he listens to the mans pitch for money You can feel him read the mans soul Its what got him his Second Best Actor Oscar for this film Harold Russell was a real veteran who lost both his hands during service in the Pacific He got a special recognition Oscar for his performance Because of that it was probably unfair to nominate him in the Supporting Actor category which he also won in His performance especially his scenes with Cathy ODonnell as his sweetheart who loves him with or without his hands is beyond anything that could be described as acting Dana Andrews is the only officer of the three a bombardier in the Army Air Corps Of the group of them maybe he should have stayed in He also comes from the poorest background of the group and he was an officer and a gentleman in that uniform That uniform and those monthly allotment checks are what got Virginia Mayo interested enough to marry him The problem is that hes considerably less in her eyes as a civilian While Mayo is fooling around with Steve Cochran Andrews has the great good fortune to have Marchs daughter Teresa Wright take an interest in him Theyre the main story of the film Andrews adjustment to civilian life and adjusting to the fact he married the wrong woman Not all veterans problems were solved with GI Bill Myrna Loy gets little recognition for The Best Years of Our Lives My guess is that its because her role as wife was too much like the stereotypical wife roles she had patented over at MGM Still as wife to March and mother to Wright she really is the glue that holds that family together The Best Years of Our Lives won for Best Picture for Sam Goldwyn Best Director for William Wyler and a few others besides the two acting Oscars it got It was a critical and popular success possibly the best film Sam Goldwyn ever produced It remains to this day an endearing and enduring classic and will be so for centuries Its almost three hours in length but never once will your interest wane The best tribute this film received came from Frank Capra who had a film of his own in the Oscar sweepstakes that year in several categories In his memoirs he said that he was disappointed to be skunked at the Oscars that year but that his friend and colleague William Wyler had created such a masterpiece he deserved every award he could get for it By the way the film Capra had hopes for was Its A Wonderful Life The Beat Years of Our Lives cant get better praise than that
0,Very disturbing but expertly crafted  scripted and intelligently directed with a good eye for color and detail Mary Beth Hurt Sandy Dennis and especially Randy Quaid are unusually good The story centers around a young boy Bryan Madorsky wondering where all the leftovers they eat every night comes from His parents Hurt Quaid strange behavior causes the school psychiatrist Dennis to get involved It is a gruesome cannibal movie But its not bad If you like Hannibal youll love this If you dont like Parents stay away from the film Just giving advice to Cannibal Lover and Haters Rated R for Strong Adult Themes and Graphic Violence
1,This film is about a deadly poison that is contained in small glass globes that is used to kill This is apparently done to hide an espionage ring intent on stealing plans for a new American bomber Now much of this plot was repeated in other Chan films THE JADE MASK and THE DOCKS OF NEW ORLEANS Additionally it was first used in MR WONG DETECTIVEall had the exploding glass globesa plot element that obviously has been overused It was interesting in MURDER OVER NEW YORK but by these later films it was rather passÃ© Fortunately the rest of the film was fresh and the plot worked out very wellwith a nifty conclusion where of course the culprit reveals himself However no plane could fly the way this one didespecially in 1940 Such extreme dives and rapid ascents were pretty silly out of this already obsolete plane By the way in a small role as a porter youll see Frank Coghlan Jrthe same actor who played Billy Batson in the CAPTAIN MARVEL serial According to IMDb Mr Coughlan is 93 years old and retired from the film industry
1,THE MATADOR 2005   Pierce Brosnan Greg Kinnear Hope Davis Philip Baker Hall Dylan Baker Brosnan gives one of his best nonBondian roles as a middleaged assassin facing a midlife crisis while on assignment in Mexico where he befriends a square yet likable American businessman Kinnear at his most affable and discovers there is more to life than death Newbie filmmaker Richard Shepard makes a solid big screen debut with a pointedly wicked black comedy with a sharp eye for visual detail and nuanced dialogue and character development that makes him a talent to watch in this breathoffreshair into the buddy comedy formula skewering what is anticipated of his leads and allowing Brosnan to get his yayas out with devilish glee A sleeper gem indie hit
0,American Pie Beta House is sort of in limbo between genres On the one hand its a comedy with no plot and few genuinely clever jokes On the other hand its porno thats a tad too softcore to actually turn on any viewers Essentially Beta House is a collage of sex scenes  some humiliating others just lame attempts at humor  with a couple thin plot points thrown in an effort at cohesiveness The characters are barely even twodimensional most development relies on knowledge of Naked Mile and the important plot scenes are so far apart that you wonder why the writers even felt the need for a story In all fairness I did not go into this movie without expectations I liked the original three American Pie movies and thought Band Camp and Naked Mile were solid rentals I thought Naked Mile was almost good enough to be released in theaters and so when I saw that some of the same characters were returning for Beta House I was excited to see this installment I was aware that there would be numerous scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in multiple forms And I was fine with it because in the past these scenes were backed by the story and were well integrated into the plot In Beta House however its almost as if the writers forgot why the formula in the other AP movies worked They spent too much energy working in the nudity that they forgot to actually write a story This movie is a disappointment and not even worth a onedollar rental The jokes are lame the story is nonexistent and the pornoaspect is too tame if thats all you really care about seeing
1,Recap Zandalee is a young woman that feels more and more trapped in her marriage with Thierry Thierry himself is struggling with the death of his father the previous year and has lost his way He has submerged himself in work laid of his writing and Zandalee desperately misses the attraction between them Into this enters Johnny and old friend of Thierrys who once were artists in exile together But Johnny has kept on painting and just have a day job for the rent He takes the day as it comes and leaves tomorrow to its destiny There is an instant raw attraction between Zandalee and Johnny and they enter into an affair But Zandalee struggles with her lust to be desired and her conscience and love for her husband But none of them not Zandalee not Johnny and not Thierry can stop the relationships between them to spin totally out of control Comments It is set as a thriller But maybe more a thriller of heart than a normal thriller where its about life and death and threat of violence Not that a thriller of heart cant take on fatal proportions but the threat comes from a different angle And it is not really until the second half in Zandalee until the thriller emerges and even though the foundation for it is laid in the first half I cant really describe the genre as a thriller then Much more of a romantic drama than anything else but with the underlying currents of other genres The developing thriller is there but it also has more than a little tint of a sensual erotic kind Because that is what it is all about what drives the characters and therefore the entire story Desire The need to have and the need to be In my opinion it is quite good definitely a lot better than its current 41 rating anyway It takes its time but it grows a good feeling of suspense and it handles the erotic part very well with taste It is always an integral part of the story needed to be there to give the story its needed weight and I never felt it was an excuse to show a naked breast or anything like that But unfortunately the climax of the story comes well before the end and the end itself feels kind of flat even if in its own way kind of dramatic The cast is impressive spearheaded by known actors like Nicholas Cage and Judge Reinhold But the show is almost completely stolen by Erika Anderson Beautiful and very adept at acting out the sometimes subtle feelings of desire she excels were both Cage and Reinhold sometimes goes a bot overboard and become a little rough Her career afterward is too thin for the talent she shows in Zandalee I can only hope it is because of her own choices Also two personal favorites appear in small roles that give some extra edge to the movie it is Steve Buscemi and Joe Pantoliano When youre in the right mood this is a very good movie it could have used another end to get the credit it really deserves 710
1,remember back when this movie was made by robert downey senior a very good entertaining black awareness feature which was an underground hit in californialos angeles and new york at the time a hippy loved classic where changes which occur in the business world are striking refreshing and interesting comedynon compliant not like basic society at the time of 1969 now watched is still very goodbut todays life in america totally diferent from 69 good for the baby boomers

1,Two snipers travel deep in the jungles in search for their targets a slimy South American druglord and a prominent general Moderately successful at building a brooding atmosphere Sniper is by most accounts a very solid thriller taking its time establishing its characters and their plight and climaxing in some good action sequences Director Llosa isnt always successful at maintaining the sombre mood and could have tightened the story somewhat some detours here dont add up to much But this film is far better than his StalloneStone travesty The Specialist Billy Zane usually incredibly tiresome does surprisingly well as the inexperienced Sniper teamed up with veteran Berenger As for Berenger this film proved to be his last good big budget Hollywood venture He can do these kind of roles in his sleep and hes very convincing here reprising the role twice more in direct to DVD sequels
1,I enjoyed this movie More than I expected It has enough action intrigue and locations to make it worth your while While I cant quite yet see Mark Wahlberg as a leader hes gotten good enough to be a credible manager and thats OK The superhero of the movie is the Mini Cooper Its shown to have the speed dexterity and muscle to pull off any job And to handle a maniac driver like Charlize Therons character
1,Pinjar is truly a masterpiece  Its a thought provoking Film that makes you think and makes you question our culture It is without a doubt the best Hindi movie I have seen to date This film should have been shown at movie festivals around the world and I believe would have been a serious contender at Cannes All the characters were perfectly cast and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai were haunting in their roles The story the movie tells about partition is a very very important story and one that should never be forgotten It has no biases or prejudices and has given the partition a human story Here no one country is depicted as good or bad There are evil Indians evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis The cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious meaningful and haunting Everything about the movie was amazingand the acting just took my breath away All were perfectly cast
1,It comes as no surprise that Larisa Shepitko was married to Elem Klimov who would later direct the most harrowing war film ever made Come and See 1985 The Ascent 1977 Â– Shepiktos final completed film before a premature death Â– is built in very much the same mould Set during WWII the film follows a pair of Soviet partisans who try to secure food for their starving army while evading the occupying German forces The first forty minutes are agonisingly tense as the two men drag themselves though the harsh snowcovered landscape the world around them completely sapped of life warmth and colour indeed so monotonously drab is the scenery that it literally took me this long to realise that the film was shot in blackandwhite Following the partisans capture by German soldiers the film becomes a cold meditation on loyalty and morality Whereas Sotnikov Boris Plotnikov refuses to betray his army even under extreme duress the less resolute Ryback Vladimir Gostyukhin attempts to save himself Is he wrong to do so Rybacks betrayal is disheartening but the film doesnt immediately condemn his actions are treacherous instead the viewer is forced to consider what their own response might be in such a situation Shepitko pities Ryback as the Bible pities Judas Both men betrayed their allies to the enemy and were forced to watch them executed However whereas Judas committed suicide by hanging at least according to Gospel of Matthew Ryback finds even that option closed to him Â– in an excruciatingly taut climax the belt around his neck becomes unfastened The Ascent draws its emotional power from Shepitkos astonishing pursuit of realism I have no doubt that the two principal actors spent days on end clambering across the snowcovered earth on their hands and knees and indeed so convincing is their misery that I actually developed a cold while watching the film seriously I did Interestingly the film interjects on this reality on several occasions as Ryback imagines himself making a bid for freedom and then being gunned down by his German captors This device though unusual works well with its Biblical allegory Ryback is facing a trial of his worthiness and faced with a new dilemma at every turn he consistently chooses the selfish alternative his own life the only deciding criteria At films end he is still alive but the nightmare of war and guilt persists
1,I agree with what veinbreaker wrote with regards to the Ahhhh feeling you get at the end of this movie I absolutely loved the locations they chose to film the songs were well written and interesting especially the psychedelic sounding track on which Hans Matheson sings Its trippy Nighy was fab in his role Nail nailed it Beano was the typical drummer and Rea kept it together Bruce Robinson was awesome Helena was a lovely girlfriend But I felt Juliet Aubreys performance was gorgeous The scenes between Aubrey  Robinson killed me Perfectly played and the music behind the scene was spot on Too bad not many more musicians have checked this movie out They ought toIve told all my musician friends great quote by Jimmy Nails character its supposed to be rock  roll not the Phantom of the fg opera
1,Many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare however every so often a movie might come along thats honest funny entertaining AND memorable The Last American Virgin is a special movie that has found its place and has stood the test of time blending all four ingredients This film follows three friends Gary Rick and David The Big Apple misadventures into the world of firsttime sex and true love Along the way they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship We follow hopeless romantic Gary The main character on his quest to win over the girl of his dreams which leads him down an uncertain road with a surprise twist at its ending If you havent been lucky enough to see this movie yet by all means take a looksprinkled with many memorable 80s songs throughout the movie to keep things moving at an even pace LAV truly is an original film a rarity among films of its genre
0,This is just one more of those hideous films that you find on Lifetime TV which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner Along with other such nasty films as The Burning Bed Enough or Monster this film takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why shes not such a bad person after all Give us a break Heres my question to the filmmakers If LeTourneau were a man and Vili were a 12 year old girl would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person Answer Hell no Imagine switching the genders in this film and then youll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage Were the genders switched there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal Instead wed likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl his lascivious behavior landing him in prison and his brainwashed victim suffering from Stockholm Syndrome The only reason LeTourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sex Lets call a spade a spade LeTourneau is a pedophile Plain and simple No ifs ands or buts Shes a criminal who belongs in prison and deserves our derision and contempt but certainly not our pity or empathy
0,This movie is lame and not funny at all The plot doesnt even make sense Some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension maybe hell and his daughter gets sucked through it or something then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit I guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously shes more interested in her new girlfriend and they stumble upon this witch spell book they want to be witches or something and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently There is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie Im sure the topless girls doesnt hurt there either The extra features on the DVD were even more confusing than the rest of the movie I thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing Who are these people and what are they doing Basically this is a gocampingtomakeoutthenfightamonster movie but there are a bunch of things like the other dimension and book seller than make it confusing I didnt like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal I dont recommend watching it though it was just too stupid I cant think of any part of the movie that was good
0,Id have to agree with the previous reviewer This film has awesome animation but has problems throughout the rest of the movie Plot holes are huge dialog barely explains the concepts of the plotthe MAIN PLOT POINTS arent even fully explained until the last five minutes of the film The characters state the obvious while failing to explain the more confusing points of the film There are characters that pop up and have importance in the storyline that are never explainedmost of them have names that are only mentioned once and it is exceedingly confusing to a viewer Dont waste your time with this movie Unless you are in it for a good laugh and how DUMB it is
1,I could watch this movie ALL DAY I LOVE it Probably my all time favorite movies But by the way badger1970 there are a few parts with bad language not TOO bad but its not exactly G rated GREAT movie I recommend it to everybody Any way its making me type 10 lines of text so I am going to keep typing until it will let me post this comment Okay Still typing This is getting annoying Ugh I still have four more to go Anyway WATCH THIS MOVIE Even if you have already seen it I DONT CARE Has it been 10 lines yet Nope Only 2 more lines left I dont even know why it wants me to do this I think I am done Wait a minute Im NOT done SORRY people I know its torture listening to me WEll I suppose that you dont HAVE to read this comment But you should because I wrote it I am probably done now Finally bye
0,Spoilers abound You have been warned I was thoroughly disappointed this being my first STREET FIGHTER movie I have seen I dare not go near the 1994 joke yet Very little grabs your attention in STREET FIGHTER ZERO ALPHA as opposed to most japanimation The fights are hilariously done over board Shun versus Zangief was a laugher and the dramatization is far too moody especially toward the end when Ryu has to control everything in his fight against his brother The main street fighter Ryu has been weakening to a far darker version inside of himself Frustrations in controlling this darkness are further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother A shady street fighting tournament is held with more than just fighting on the promoter s mind What is with the artist s drawing of feet Any anime drawn above the stomach is impressive The story s soft nature makes the STREET FIGHTER genre far too intelligent and places far more emphasis on a character Shun that is not even a fighter in the video game A character study on more than just the core stars of the original STREET FIGHTER is completely ignored How many times did you catch Rolento Adon Guy STREET FIGHTER ZERO lacks the imagination of the video game
0,For the first couple of seasons I thought The Apprentice was a highly engaging and exciting show The combination between reality TV and a 16 week jobinterview was innovative and the producers of the show managed to keep the show relevant and not too out there The new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with business  at all In the earlier seasons they used to put a lot more emphasis on the businessrelated tasks  now the focus is mostly in the boardroom where the contestants are expected to do EVERYTHING to keep them on the show that means lying trashtalking backstabbing etc The boardroom can be entertaining to watch but its entertainment at its lowpoint  Sometimes you wonder if you are watching a repeat of an old Jerry Springer episode The tasks on the show are at most boring and mostly a showcase for the companies who are dumb enough to pay NBC for the publicity And what is the deal about half of the contestants living in tents in season 6 That is just plain stupid and has nothing to do with business in reallife  I have absolutely NO respect for any of the contestants this season they all seem like idiots to me In earlier seasons at least some of the contestants had a bit of integrity now it seems like the contestants would kill their own mother to keep them on the show It also seems like Donald Trumps massive ego becomes bigger and bigger for every season that pass by and to be honest I cant see why anyone with a common sense would want to work for him His rationality in the boardroom mostly doesnt make any sense at all and sometimes it seems he just like to trash people for what its worth RIP The Apprentice Please NBC for Gods sake get the show off the air as soon as possible Its just too embarrassing to watch The Apprentice was once a great TVshow but now its just a big fat joke
0,Honestly I went to see the movie not because of the actors not because of the plot but because it was rated 17 here in Luxembourg and a movie has to be really brutal or pornographic to be put in this category Believe me being a moviefreak I have seen quite a lot of brutal films in my lifetime Ichi the killer Irreversible Hellraiser but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture I have ever seen  The plot is plain stupid the directing is awful acting was mediocre even the music was a cheap copy of socalled Horror Soundtracks There isnt a single intelligent aspect in the whole movie and some of the scenes are really hard to stand especially the scene where you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the baby crieshorrible I cant understand why the movie was rated 16 in Germany where normally the criteria are real tough eg killbill brutal but it made fun of itself and had great allusions to Asian cinema and besides a magnificent directing even a movie like state of grace is rated 18 No one can call this a Horror movie because actually it was more about showing gore than about scaring the public Showing the Creeps face in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision for me excuse my expression it is just one insane director living out his disturbing fantasies In some scenes you see violence that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot nor does it explain anything The plot has holes and flaws the dialog is boring honestly I cant mention a single positive aspect of the movie except for the British and Scottish accent If I had something to say I would ban this movie from the theaters I fully understand why none of the big production companies invested their money in this crap Im looking forward to getting feedbacks to my thread and Id be happy to discuss about one or the other topic Livin the dream baby livin the dream David Aames
0,I literally ran to watch it expecting a film that will make me cry or touch my heart What I found was not heartrending but a lame exploitation of 1 strong human character Interwined between a pair of young lesbians and an obese man In a setting that is substantially devoid of sound not to mention acting of the most common It was not entirely BAD as I have seen worst  and I left the cinema 10 poorer but wiser  that a FILM well advertised is not the same as a FILM WELLMADE
1,Richard Abernethie a very wealthy man has died and his relatives have assembled for his funeral Included in the funeral party is Abernathies youngest sister Cora Galaccio While none of the family has seen Cora in at least 20 years they all agree that Cora was always a bit different So when Cora says something about Abemethie having been murdered most laugh it off as one of Coras eccentricities But someone is obviously taking Cora seriously The next day Cora is found dead in her bed having been beaten violently Is there a connection between the two deaths Its up to Hercule Poirot to find a killer After the Funeral is one of the most well put together episodes of the entire Poirot series Ive always been a fan of this particular Agatha Christie book and from what I remember the movie is as faithful to Christies source material as any of the Poirot installments The mystery is top notch with plenty of clues suspects and red herrings And as Ive written before I always enjoy an Christie story where Hercule Poirot gathers everyone together in a drawing room for the final reveal It might be old fashioned but thats the way I like it Getting beyond the plot technically and artistically After the Funeral is a winner Sets editing direction and cinematography are as good as youll find in one of these movies The acting is equally impressive Ive come to expect an enjoyable performance from David Suchet as Poirot and he doesnt disappoint here The rest of the cast is just as strong with Monica Dolan giving an especially noteworthy performance Other than a minor quibble with the rapid fire way the characters are introduced Ive got no real complaints Its a good show all the way around

0,Having not read the original book or seen the earlier film and indeed knowing nothing about the storyline of either of those or the current film I came to this film with an open mind Its really difficult to know where to start a comment on the film because the whole thing seems so confused It seems like there is a point or a message or something in the film but what that is remains completely obscure The effects were fantastic and very well judged The idea was set up really well with the motivation for time travel clearly made out However it was downhill from here All of the time travel seems to have only the vaguest connection to the quest that was set out at the start There are some nice ideas but they seem to be isolated occurrences that really do not flow and make the film seem disjointed and lost At one point one wonders whether the main story in the film is the fate of the moon When Hartdegen arrives in 802701 AD the film becomes very frustrating as he seems to be unable to discover anything of importance about the Eloi and while it seems clear that there is something to find out what it is remains annoyingly elusive This is quite an odd change from the previous time travel instances and one wonders why all of this has suddenly been abandoned for what seems like a completely new story So many things happen that there should be an explanation for but there is no discovery I really really wanted to know what the film was getting at what there was to uncover but to no avail Having read a summary of what happens in the book at this point it seems like there has been a very halfhearted attempt to render this in the film but it has been so simplified and dumbed down that the meaning and context is completely lost Just as we hope that we are finally to discover where this is all leading the film suddenly takes another significant change in direction and becomes a mindless action film without any real action It is as if by this point the director has simply given up bothering to put any meaning into the film By now countless significant things are happening without any explanation Hartdegen fails to take the opportunity to return to the past on two occasions for no reason and then suddenly loses all interest in time travel for no reason The film comes to an abrupt end as Hartdegen decides to stay with the Eloi In summary after a good start the film is very disappointing Too much time is spent on Hartdegens adventures before arriving with the Eloi However the worst part of the film is what I think is the most important part the setting up of the situation with the Eloi The whole point is completely missed and this undermines the rest of the film After this the film concentrates too much on effects and action and all attempts to return to the meaning and core of the film seem forced and out of place With so many things happening without explanation the film just seems to get lost and lose direction However the finale where Hartdegen decides he is no longer bothered about time travel is the most inexplicable of all Ultimately the whole film seemed like a collection of unconnected incidents The meaning and context was lost although the gaping hole where it should have been was very obvious What was so frustrating about it all though was that there was clearly so much potential here it wasnt by any means a bad film it just so easily could have been so much better The start was very promising the time travelling looked fantastic and would have worked had it not gone off on tangents and Hartdegens experience with the Eloi could so easily have worked had a few more of the right questions been asked and had there not been such a temptation to dumb down and simplify I just wish I had a time machine so that I could travel back in time and advise against the mistakes that were made
0,I still cant believe how bad this movie was If I wasnt a massochist I dont know if I would have survived the viewing It looks like it cost about 1000 to make but it wasnt the money that brought them down The acting was horrid  not just bad 3rd graders could have read the lines better Second the only other reason to watch this kind of movie is the skin and that is sorely lacking in this flick We dont even get to see the more attractive chicas in the buff  Ahh well better luck next time eh
1,Yokai Monsters Spook Warfare Yokai daisenso 2005 a movie about yokai or traditional Japanese monsters of folklore It is alternatively known as Big Monster War or as Ghosts on Parade The yokai of the first installment include the teapot freak kappa water imp a living brella a woman whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic a woman with a second face on the back of her head a dwarf priest with an enormous gourdlike wrist  so on These sorts of whimsical monsters derive not only from fairy lore but from a type of summer entertainment of the Tokugawa Era comparable to todays Halloween haunted houses or the freak shows of yesteryear but with exclusively phony freaks Ghosts  goldfish monsters  dancing oneheaded umbrellas were trumped up to create chills during the hot summers The fatcheek woman  such were recreated by tricks or illusions based on monsters depicted in medieval scrolls  if their design for the movie is a bit simple  hoky this makes them all the more representative of what historically was recreated for summer chills These rather endearing monsters have to face off  destroy an ancient Babylonian vampire demon who has come to Japan  disguised himself as a samurai lord Despite that some of the Japanese apparitions are a bit goofy  too many of the costumes scarsely more than masks without even moving lips as they speak it is all played very pokerfaced  is very charming It has some beautiful cinematography much as would be provided in a CGI film of the same decade Viewed in the right mood or with the right friends it is exciting moving  touching Yoshiyuki Kuroda also directed the famed Lone Wolf  Cub White Heaven  Hell 1974 and was the special FX director for the excellent Daimajin trilogy The Yokai Monsters series is not the equal of Majin at its best but the Yokai are nevertheless great fun The first miike movie which is the most childoriented of his family films with the GOZU  IZOO consecutively more serious though none too severe for young viewers
0,When converting a book to film it is generally a good idea to keep at least some of the authors intended tone or conveyed concepts rather than ignoring the author altogether While it is clear that the director had access to and went on the advice of Elinore Stewarts children it is key to note that the children believed their mother to be a complete liar in regards to the good enriching strengthening experiences of homesteading her land The book details her life on her and her husbands adjoining homesteads in the vast Wyoming frontier she chronicles daily adventures with her numerous friends and acquaintances though they lived dozens of miles apart The film however takes a standard stance for the time it was made portraying this womans experience as harsh unforgiving and nearly pointless Perhaps the director was bringing some of his Vietnam War experiences with him to this movie as some film aficionados have said but it seems to be a lousy excuse for taking all the joy and beauty of the book and twisting it into a bleak odious landscape devoid of friends or hope Dont waste your time with this movie read the book instead
1,I love this freekin movie Walsh is a true master of the cinematic form his film have been sometimes in my opinion overlooked But this film is a favourite of mine because it really gives you the feel of the time the film was set in\ All the wonderful characters that existed the lifestyle the mode of dress the way they spoke OK they might be exaggerated but it is good to know that there were occasion when two men tried to outdo each other with insane stunts I just felt it was apiece of history thats should be wathced by many people and appreciated because of that fact Can I get it somewhere on DVD I have only seen it on TV But for anyone wanting a slice of life movie about that period of time this is the perfect one
0,This movie wasnt awful but it wasnt very good I am a big fan Toni Collette I think she is a very beautiful and talented actress The movie starts off about Robin Williams who is a writer and gets a book from a 14 year old kid The book is great and he cantt believe a kid wrote it Toni Collette plays the kids guardian who you dont know if this kid really exists or if shes making it all up I am not gonna ruin the movie but I will say this the movie is not scary The acting is pretty good and Toni Collettes performance was awesome as well as Robin Williams  The movie was a huge disappointment in my opinion I would wait for it to come to DVD
1,Ben Thomas Smith plays an IRS Agent who practically gives the store away to everyones surprise What kind of IRS Agent is this Most of us have all heard the line by an IRS Agent Hello Im from the IRS Im here to help Our smile then spreads into a chuckle that says Yeah right As you get further and further into this story you cannot figure this guy out He goes easy on those who are being audited What is his motive Is he from another planet an angel a rich guy who wants to do good He helps so much we want him to be our auditor should we get audited of course Hey IRS are you listening kidding just kidding The pace of the movie is perfect and so much so that clues were ignored that would have told me what was really going on Intense repeat intense focus was on Ben and stays there The whole movie only works because of Ben as we try to figure him out and I didnt see any clues what clues you talking about Willis Not reading the box before watching the DVD movie was the better way to go here By the end of the movie I finally put it all together Well it was obvious by then And yes its over the top but still a great story mostly because of Will Smith  Will Smith should have been nominated for a Best Actor Award The rest of the cast were very good as well  Yes its over the top and despite the great acting and when you finally get all the answers you must realize that the message of the movie is all wrong Whats the message Believe me you will wont need too many clues to figure it out I didnt  Violence No Sex Yes but nothing to get excited about Bland Nudity No Language No
0,The worst film I have seen in the last 12 months The plot of the story was uninteresting the movie ended when he became gingesh khan i always thought there happened something really interesting afterwards i knew that Mongolia and all the areas where the movie played have beautiful landscapes but the movie didnt profit from that The jokes where really poor The narrator gingesh himself could have told a bit more about Mongolian history traditions etc My coviewer knew nothing about that at all so he was a bit lost I was so looking forward to see this film but was really disappointed after all It was one out of 3 movies I have ever seen in cinema where I considered to leave before the end
0,This is officially the terrible boring corny and ridiculous movie ever created The movie is all about a crazy kid and his friends and they land a 747 His dreams are very corny and make no sense at all and is very poorly done Every special effect looks as if it was done without any modern technology and might have been created by the kid that plays the leading role in the movie If you watch this movie it will definitely make you stupider I advise you to never consider watching this movie and if you do good luck and dont miss the brain cells you killed off My comment does not even fully grasp the awful creation from hell that has been made The person that wrote the comment before me did not watch the same movie that I dreadfully watched and wish I never watched Peace
1,Once upon a time in Sweden there was a poor Salvation Army sister At deaths door she requests Send for David Holm But Victor SjÃ¶strÃ¶m as David Holm cannot be located because he is spending New Years Eve in a graveyard with his drinking buddies Dying Sister Astrid Holm as Edit wants to see if praying for Mr SjÃ¶strÃ¶ms soul over the past year has produced any results arguably it has not In the graveyard SjÃ¶strÃ¶m tells the story of The Phantom Carriage which he heard from his dead friend Tore Svennberg as Georges According to legend the last person to die in each year must pick up the souls of all the dead people until being relieved next New Years Eve Director SjÃ¶strÃ¶m whose lead performance is very strong combines with photographer Julius Jaenzon to create a visually appealing film The great double exposure effect is used frequently but never seems overdone and it doesnt make the films other dramatic highlights any less memorable for example SjÃ¶strÃ¶ms tearing of his sewn coat and axing of the door A Selma LagerlÃ¶f story probably wasnt one you could or would want to tamper with in the 1920s  which may or may not be why the ending of this film is a letdown And unlike similar spiritual stories its difficult to suspend your disbelief if you think too carefully about what is really happening in KÃ¶rkarlen  KÃ¶rkarlen 1121 Victor SjÃ¶strÃ¶m  Victor SjÃ¶strÃ¶m Hilda BorgstrÃ¶m Tore Svennberg
1,It may interest people to know that this film was made without any recourse to Phoolan Devi herself and when she did finally see parts of it was so enraged that she announced that the film was not to be shown in India or she would cover herself in petrol and set fire to herself I do not know whether it was shown at all or not but given her standing at the time as a rising politician I doubt it Since then I saw a report that she has been ousted from office and charged with further crimes from her Dacoit days and has gone into hiding as a result Her own concerns aside this is an excellent film made all the more so by its refreshingly brutal approach none of the rosetinted melodrama one might expect from a typical indian film It should be stressed that concerns about how feminist the films messages really are and the like are essentially irrelevant its a true story Her misgivings are it seems not with what is depicted but with the way in which the film depicts her
1,Being that I am a true product of the hiphop and electronic dance music generation this is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time Beat Street although not as authentic in some respects as Wild Style is a film that is guaranteed to tug the heart strings of anyone who takes pride in the culture of urban sampleDJbased music and electroclub culture Although I will admit that at times the dialogue is somewhat cheesy you cant help but feel for the characters and ultimately wish you were there for the beginnings of hiphop culture in New York City in the early eighties The bboy battle scene at the Roxy nightclub a reallife realtime competition between the legendary Rock Steady Crew and the NYC Breakers is just as essential to a hiphop fans archives as any classic album Watch some of the breakers moves in slowmotion if possible to truly appreciate the athletic and stylistic expertise of a seasoned BboyBgirl All praises due to the Zulu Nation
1,I finally got myself set up on mail order DVD rental so I could find movies not available to me in the stores I chose The Souler Opposite because I love Christopher Meloni and also like small often ignored films This one is such a treat Meloni has such charm in this part Its easy to pigeon hole him is you only ever see him as his alter ego Elliot Stabler LOSVU In this film Meloni is an out of step unattached midlifer who is hitting the skids in many ways only to find a path to happiness in someone unexpected The relationship drawn between Barry Meloni and Tim Busfields character is realistic and not over done I havent seen Busfield since 30something and he was fun to watch But it was all Chris film I became such a fan girl all over again It is a bit slow in the beginning I will admit I thought some of the flashbacks could have been edited down But overall this film will delight you  male or female  as it has an honest refreshing view of relationships today
1,Gurinda Chadas semiautobiographical film 2002 is a gentle poignant comedy set in the ethnically diverse community near Heahthrow Airport in West London Like the airliners which constantly arrive and depart from overhead we follow the ups and downs of the two main characters Jess Bhamra Parminder Nagra and Jules Paxton Keira Knightley as they strike up an unlikely friendship which centres around their mutual passion for soccer and their technical infatuation with David Beckham Much of the comedy grows out of the misunderstandings of the families of these two talented girls as they break all the expectations and conventions of their very different family backgrounds Somewhere in the middle as broker peacemaker and blighted athlete Joe Jonathan ReeceMyers  team coach for the Hounslow Harriers  intercedes in times of crisis while at the same time remaining the main object of affection of both the main characters Eventually and not without many obstacles and triumphs on the way we finally see our dedicated and beloved soccer heroines soaring away to realise their dreams With great performances from Bollywood veteran Anupam Kher Mr Bhamra Shaheen Khan Mrs Bhamra Juliet Stevenson Mrs Paxton and Frank Harper Mr Paxton this really is a film that captures the urgent passion of adolescence and crosses all ethnic frontiers Pinky Bamrha Archie Panjabi and Taz Trey Farley are struggling their own struggles but nevertheless contribute greatly to our understanding of the main characters in the film In its own special way this film tells an important story that in quite incidental the football It celebrates the evolution in the understanding of ordinary people in ordinary families and the innate ability of the young to teach the old
0,Woody Allen made September proving that even a genius could screw up This is Mel Brooks September Monumentally stupid boring and unfunny I must confess I did not watch it through to the end The flick ranks among the dishonored few eg The Money Pit Out to Sea Spitfire Grill which either put me to sleep or forced me to reach for the rewind button And I say this sadly as a devoted Mel Brooks fan He should stick to straight comedy and leave social commentary alone How the same fellow that made Young Frankenstein and Spaceballs could crank out a dog like this is beyond me To be avoided at all costs
0,What bird is that  A maltese falcon The only thing remotely funny about this movie is Michael Caines hair Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue Salutes to Raymond Chandler and Humphrey Bogart and crime fiction etc seem obtuse and just plain silly without the salvation of any humour or pertinency The reason this film has no longevity and near forgotten is its so vacuous an hour and half of pointless time spent in the company of second rate actors and film makers  This film is what the title suggests
0,Wow what a racist profane piece of celluloid garbage and what an insult to the great genre of Westerns Exploitive Sex scenes abound profanity abounds violence and gore aboundseverything that gives modern movies such a good name especially among those who prefer classicera movies This is the kind of sleaze that gives the old folks ammunition against todays films  Somehow I just cant picture nude male bathing scenes in Randolph Scott or Gene Autrey films Nor can I picture hearing motherfer exclaimed here and there I sincerely doubt that word was even around over 100 years ago Yet the fword is so prevalent here youd think you were watching a story centered in todays urban areas not the old west of the 1800s Prejudice Well what if all the white characters were good guys and every black person was the nasty brutal villain Do you think someone might complain about a racist movie Home come we dont hear an outcry when the reverse  as demonstrated in this film  is shown in hundreds of theaters across the country Mario Van Peeples wrote directed and starred in this bomb Remember that name Apparently he is the Ed Wood of todays filmmakers Even Spike Lee wouldnt be this racist You cant get much worse than this movie
0,This film is deeply disappointing Not only that Wenders only displays a very limited musical spectrum of Blues it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely boring The only highlight of the movie is the interview of a Swedish couple who were befriended with JB Lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories Wenderss introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly  alluding to worlds culture or actually American culture traveling in space but his limited looks on the theme as well as the neither funny nor utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s renders this movie as a mere sleeping aid Yawn I had expected more of him
0,RKS films always have been commercial films which suited the 90s from GHAYAL DAMINI His last few films KHAKEE were watchable FAMILY was crap This film is a decent film but could be better The problem lies in there is lot of old fashioned clichÃ©s thrown in and many scenes come out too filmy and lengthy Ajay Devgans character is shown very well but his character gets heroic which could be subtle The lengthy flashback could be avoided as thigns are simply long drawn Even the street play in the second half look too simplistic and hardly a solution though the message is well brought out Direction by RKS is decent though it could be better Music is okay Ajay Devgan looks the part very well and is at ease playing his part mostly though at times he does look ill at ease in light scenes He excels in dramatics Vidya excels in the scene front of media Pankaj has a not proper defined role and too filmy yet he excels in his part Darshan Jariwala hams as the old age villain the rest are okay
0,Perhaps I couldnt find the DVD menu selection for PLOT ON OFF Clearly the default is OFF When the end credits began to roll I couldnt believe that was it Like our poor but beautiful protagonist I felt used dirty cheap The characters were drawn in very broad strokes and the writers disdain for wealthy Thatcherites was all to apparent I consider myself a Roosevelt Democrat but would appreciate a bit more subtlety Of course the problem could be with me I see that many others seem to find some meaning or message in this picture Alas not I  The only thing that kept me from giving this a 1 was the nice scenery human and plant
1,This one will get reviews all over the map because it doesnt comfortably fit any mold Its horror but not a splatterfest Its equal part Suspense as well as Horror yet without the usual Hollywood screams and jerky camera  The feel of the movie is spare and lean with next to no special effects because I think you should listen and watch the faces of the characters Forget that Brendan is a graduate of the Buffy universe Thats a red herring He IS acting here Camp is a misreading of the tone of this story Adrienne Barbeau is giving a rock solid performance so she must believe the script has something to say We all know the sorry excuses where the actors plainly dont care anymore and are just waiting for the director to snap Cut and get their paychecks This is Not the case here Forgive the fact that the bodies begin to fall with almost mondofunny regularity I dont think the intent was humorous but to keep you off balance  Think of it less of a Horror Movie and more of a Horror Play on a stage that decrepit whitewashed house Then you might see its really about paranoia fear and spiralling madness set in an isolated someplace USA And it is twisty Time travel Mind Control secret experiments and Nazis who may NOT be dead  yet I say rent it and give it a try if youre in the mood for something a little cerebral This would be a good choice for a Saturday Midnight sit down
0,Frank Tashlins Censored is a soso Private Snafu short which aims to teach the importance of the Censor in stopping military secrets from leaking out Snafu attempts to get word out to his girlfriend that hes to be stationed in the South Pacific but the Censor foils each attempt he makes to send the letter These early scenes are the best with the unseen Censor plucking the letter out of the sky with long mechanical arms nets and even a specially employed eagle The second half of the cartoon in which Snafu manages to send the letter with the aid of Technical Fairy First Class who is actually teaching him a lesson is less funny and climaxes with a disappointing onlyadream finale The main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of Snafus extremely scantily clad girlfriend who is even seen barebreasted albeit with strategically placed limbs at all times Aimed at the military the Snafu shorts were often characterised by a heightened bawdiness but these scenes crowbarred in as they may be are by far the most erotic Ive come across in any of these shorts thus far Despite all this I prefer the Snafu shorts that go for the jugular a little more usually resulting in the death of the main character For great examples of this seek out Tashlins The Goldbrick or Chuck Joness Spies Censored is fairly weak by comparison
1,Sacchi is the best Bogart impersonator ever dry and droll as Sam Marlowe The music from award winning composer George Duning From Here To Eternity Picnic The World of Suzie Wong the cinematography of perfect locations including the famous Ambassador Hotel are all right on target as famous tv director Robert Day Kojak Streets of San Francisco The Avengers guides the most endearing group of wellknown character actors through a spoof of every dark detective film every made See this if you loved all the old serious flicks and have a sense of humor this one is a hoot
0,I had never heard of this one before it turned up on Cable TV Its very typical of late 50s scifi sober depressing and not a little paranoid Despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple the film is pretty much put across in a documentary style  which is perhaps a cheap way of leaving a lot of the exposition to narration and an excuse to insert as much stock footage as is humanly possibly for what is unmistakably an extremely lowbudget venture While not uninteresting in itself theapocalypseviarenegademissile angle later utilized with far greater aplomb for both DR STRANGELOVE 1964 and FAILSAFE 1964 and mercifully short the films singleminded approach to its subject matter results in a good deal of unintentional laughter  particularly in the scenes involving an imminent childbirth and a gang of clueless juvenile delinquents
0,A good idea badly implemented While that could summarize 99 of the SciFi channels movies it really applies here I love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed and I like action movies and I like all of the main actors so this could have been great However despite some good acting this movie fails due to Bill Platts bad writing and directing Another review made the good point of needing to know where youre going so you can get there This movie doesnt Its put together in such a haphazard way that you know the words second draft are not in Bill Platts vocabulary There is one scene that is entirely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone noticing This scene even begins and ends with them driving a car so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middle This movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others some to the point where you can guess the entire plot up front It also had a habit of aborting a fight early probably just because they couldnt afford it There are also a few laughably bad scenes where the plot is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed toxic adhesive seriously what is that If you are a fan of Shiri Appleby watch this movie because shes OK She does manage to break out of her Roswell persona a few times and make for a good tough chick but not always John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything hes ever done since playing Q back in STTNG so thats nothing new In all I gave this movie a 410 rating
0,Its the one film I almost walked out of and would have if my friends hadnt been in the movie theatre with me Normally even if I dont like a film I think its still worth sitting through it to the end That way you can really claim to have given it every chance to redeem itself But with The Million Dollar Hotel it was so dreadful I just badly wanted the experience to end as quickly as possible I think I probably would not have been so sourly disappointed if this film had been made by a lesser director one I didnt normally like so much But coming from Wenders it was all the more shocking to behold I know Bono from U2 a good friend of Wenderss wrote the script to this abysmal film and I wonder why Wenders let him as buddybuddy as the two may have been Stick to the day job Bono is a sentence that easily springs to mind whilst viewing this mess Pretentious disjointed a mishmash of every possible contemporary film stereotype a naive and transparent attempt at coming across as kooky and daring with the most irritating characters I have ever set eyes upon especially the leads Jeremy Davies Milla Jovovich and Mel Gibson none of whom I dislike normally The happiest ending I could have wished for would have been for a nuclear bomb to be dropped on their collective heads so as to get it all over with as soon as possible On a positive note the first five minutes of the film are extremely good with an extremely stirring soundtrack from U2 But the films opening shots make the rest of the film which takes a spectacular nosedive from then on all the more disappointing as they are a promise of cinematic quality thats just never delivered not even close
0,The production company for this film calls itself Nott Entertainment and that is a surprisingly apt name This very is very Nott entertaining from start to finish which is a shame because a mix of zombie movie and western could have been interesting Every time a low budget zombie movie is released it will tend to be for the fans by the fans I do actually consider myself a fan of zombie movies but too many more like this one and Ill be reevaluating my opinion The film seems to be a ripoff of the halfdecent Aussie zombie flick Undead expect instead of just having the lead in a cowboy hat everyone is wearing one but this doesnt make a lot of sense because the film is apparently set in modern times The credits sequence at the start of the movie fools us into believing that were going to be in for an atmospheric film but when the movie starts properly it soon becomes apparent what were actually in for Naturally theres a fair amount of gore and it is actually fairly well done though the good things I have to say about the film pretty much end there Theres a twist half way through which might have been interesting if the rest of the film was Overall this is just another zombie movie in a world with far too many zombie movies I dont recommend it
0,I just watched this film 15 minutes ago and I still have no idea what I just watched Mainly I think its a film about an internet SM star of CD Roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online Shes murdered by someone which causes her sister and a crack team of 2 FBI agents to investigate the death The local homicide division of Big City USA is also investigating though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the CD ROMs which he claims are as realistic as the real thing I know Wow Michael Madsen is the only one in the film that has any kind of credits behind him Hes in the film for about 15 minutes and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason I wont even explain the ending because quite frankly I cant make it out myself But before the final scene were treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film Honestly they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and all All in all stay away from this film I got it because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen I really could have used that 80 some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied Like playing that game with a knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly That for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining
